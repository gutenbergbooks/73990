</div>

<p>The present conspicuous position which Northern
Nigeria holds in the public eye is of very recent
attainment, and its development has been, comparatively
speaking, the work of a moment. The
discovery of tin in paying quantities within its
boundaries is the secret of its sudden leap to an
eminence from which it compels interest, and attracts
to itself more than ordinary curiosity and attention.
It is with Northern Nigeria as it was with
New South Wales and California, with the Malay
Peninsula and Rhodesia. Their potentialities
were admitted long before the existence of their
mineral wealth was made known, but it was
not until their minerals were discovered that
they loomed into absorbing prominence.</p>

<p>The importance of Northern Nigeria as a British
possession was demonstrated by the Niger Company;
her possibilities as an exporter of cotton,
rubber, and other vegetable products were early
admitted; but it needed the revelation of her enormous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
alluvial tin deposits in the Province of
Bauchi to attract to the development of her
resources the capital and enterprise which alone
can ensure the growth of a country’s commerce.</p>

<p>But this sudden and surprising discovery also
served to expose the widespread ignorance which
prevailed in connection with our newest Protectorate,
while it generated a desire for information
concerning it. This little volume is put
forward to satisfy this new-felt want, and it has,
I think, the merit of being the first issued with
that object. It has been compiled in haste, but
care has been taken to verify the facts, and, as
far as possible, the data has been derived from
official sources.</p>

<p>I believe that no apology will be required for
the illustrations, but for the use of the photographs
from which they were produced I tender
my grateful and sincere thanks to his Excellency
Sir Walter Egerton, K.C.M.G., Governor and
High Commissioner of Southern Nigeria; Sir
William Wallace, K.C.M.G., late Acting Governor
of Northern Nigeria; Mr. H. W. Laws, Engineer
to the Niger Company; Mr. C. G. Lush, Consulting
Engineer to the principal Nigerian Tin Companies;

mining companies; the Editor of the <i>Engineer</i>,

<h1>NIGERIA &amp; ITS TIN FIELDS</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EARLY_DAYS_IN_NIGERIA">EARLY DAYS IN NIGERIA</h2>

</div>

<p>In 1879, when Sir George Taubman Goldie
organised the amalgamation of the rival trading
firms of the Lower Niger and formed the United
Africa Company, only a few far-sighted people
could have had any idea of the possibilities of
future commercial greatness that were possessed
by this utterly unattractive and uncivilised region.
“The Niger,” as Colonel Mockler-Ferryman tells
us, “was absolutely tabooed; its name was mentioned
only in whispers, and the British public
regarded it as an unlucky, pestilential spot, out of
which no good could ever come.” It must be
remembered, in explanation of this pessimistic
attitude, that all attempts to explore Nigeria and
open up commerce on the river had failed more
or less completely; a great number of lives had
been sacrificed in successive expeditions, and no
practical good had been accomplished. McGregor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
Laird, some quarter of a century earlier, had
founded the African Shipping Company, with
monthly sailings to the West African ports and,
with the grudging co-operation of the Government,
had contracted to keep a steamer on the
Niger. But Laird died in 1857, when his spirited
enterprise appeared to be on the point of yielding
tangible results, and the country was still under a
cloud when, twenty years later, the first organised
attempt was made to develop its commercial
resources.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PROTECTORATE_PROCLAIMED">THE PROTECTORATE PROCLAIMED</h2>

</div>

<p>The United Africa Company’s efforts were
recognised by the grant of a Royal Charter in
1886, but its mission and its potentialities failed
to appeal to the general public; and even when in
1900 the Territory, with its area equal to that of
Germany and the British Isles combined, was
added to the Dependencies of the Empire, the new
Protectorate was regarded with indifference and
suspicion as a present burden and a probable
source of future trouble.</p>

<p>That was but a decade since, yet it was only
the other day that Lord Crewe declared that
“there is no part of the Empire about which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
higher hopes may properly be entertained than
the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria;” and the
Colonial Report, in emphatic corroboration of
this optimistic opinion, asserted that “very few
countries have witnessed such great changes for
the better in such a short space of time, as has
been the case with this Cinderella of the British
Dominions.”</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the Nigerias have
been of late years more favoured in the matters
of ocean transport and inter-communication.
Since McGregor Laird started his monthly service
to Lagos, the African Shipping Company
has been succeeded by six shipping lines—the
British and African Steam Navigation, African
Steamship, Elder Dempster, Woermann, Hamburg-America,
and the Hamburg-Bremen-Africa—the
first three of which, to all intents and
purposes, may be classed as Elder Dempster’s.
Twenty-five liners and Elder Dempster’s regular
services call at Lagos each month—one nearly
every day of the week. Two vessels of some
four thousand tons are exclusively employed in
bringing Welsh coal to Lagos; and a cargo service,
another Elder Dempster enterprise, now runs
from inside Lagos Lagoon to Hamburg, thus
avoiding the transhipping of cargo in Lagos Roads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
or at Forcados. Persons who only know of
Elder Dempster’s famous service of ocean liners,
which leave Liverpool every Wednesday and arrive
at Lagos Roads sixteen days later, may be surprised
to learn that they have a large and distinct
inter-colonial service between Lagos and Secondi.
These vessels, built of light draught to enable
them to cross Lagos bar, not only afford shippers
a short and rapid means of forwarding their
produce, but are of immense service to the growing
number of natives who travel, mostly for
trade purposes, between Lagos and the smaller
ports along the Gold Coast; while another Elder
Dempster service runs weekly to and from Porto
Novo in Dahomey and Lagos, carrying general
outward cargo and bringing back produce for
shipment to the United Kingdom and the Continent.</p>

<p>These services, which cater for the ramifications
of the commercial activities of West Africa,
are practically unknown at home, and the organisation
and development of this enormous industry
was, to a great extent, the work of one man—the
late Sir Alfred Lewis Jones. It has been said of
him that “when the story of our times comes to
be written comprehensively, he will be bracketed
with Cecil John Rhodes. One obtained a large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
territory for the Empire; the other enhanced
immeasurably countries formerly judged as of
questionable value. He was a pioneer in building
up their commerce, and is of still higher
estimate—he was instrumental in making them
more fit to live in by revolutionising the health
conditions.” His varied commercial enterprises in
West Africa are well known, and it is unnecessary
here to enlarge upon them. They ranged from
coaling and engineering companies with dry docks,
to banking—which facilitated relations between the
natives and the European traders—and included
his cold-storage scheme, which the medical faculty
admit has been one of the most powerful factors
in lowering the mortality of West Africa. This
object was also largely assisted by the investigations
carried out at the Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine. The school was financed by
Sir Alfred Jones, who also provided the means for
putting the resultant discoveries into practice. He
further established a branch of the School at Grand
Canary, and arranged with Elder Dempster a cheap
service from the West African Coast to the Canary
Islands for malaria patients, whose lives depend
upon their reaching that Mecca for invalids. By
such means the dead merchant prince has lowered
the death-rate among Europeans and natives in West<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
Africa to a degree unthought of fifteen years ago,
and he has built in that part of the Continent a
monument to his name more enduring than brass,
because the foundation was made for the betterment
of his fellow-men.</p>

<h3>THE NIGER COMPANY</h3>

<p>But if the Elder Dempster Line have accomplished
great things in establishing regular
communication between England and the new
Dependencies, much splendid pioneer work has
been done in the country by the Niger Company.
During the last few years they have opened up
the Bauchi tin field in Northern Nigeria, and
their trading and transport facilities have made
it possible for them to carry out an enormous
amount of development under great difficulties.
The directors have had the courage of their convictions.
In forwarding their own interests they
have benefited the Protectorate, and if they have
profited by their enterprise they have made the
country a source of profit for others.</p>

<p>From the proceeds of the surrender of its charter
to the British Government in 1900, the company
were able to make a special distribution to its
shareholders amounting to 145 per cent., and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
sale of certain of their mining rights in the
Bauchi Province has more than repaid them for
the work that they had carried on in the district
since 1902, and resulted in raising their dividend
payment in 1909 from ten to twenty per cent.
And in addition the Niger Company possess
practically a monopoly of the transport to the
tin fields, the value of which cannot be overestimated.</p>

<p>The Niger Company’s share of the credit that
is due for effecting this great improvement in the
present condition and future prospects of the Protectorate
may be at once admitted; but much has
been accomplished since the control of the country
devolved upon the British Colonial Office. In 1900
only some 30,000 square miles, out of a total of
250,000 in Northern Nigeria, were under some
form of organised control. The remainder was
controlled and ruled under conditions giving no
guarantee of liberty or even life. To-day the
whole condition of the country is entirely altered.
Sixteen provinces, comprising the entire Protectorate,
have been organised by the never-ceasing
efforts of Residents, and the sum total
of the unadministered area does not now exceed
the 30,000 square miles that were under administration
ten years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<h3>PROGRESS OF SOUTHERN NIGERIA</h3>

<p>At the date of the proclamation of the Nigerian
Protectorates the Southern Colony was in a much
more advanced state of development than its
Northern neighbour, and was naturally regarded
as the paramount partner. It had a sea border,
a port at Lagos, which to-day is the most important
town in West Africa, and it was destined
to be the terminus of the first railway to be built
in the new Dependencies. The markets and
trading stations of the Niger Company were
within its boundaries, the fertility of the soil was
proved, its richness in rubber, tobacco, and coal
was established, and its wealth of other vegetable
products was well known. It is not at all surprising,
then, that British pioneers and capitalists
saw the splendid commercial future that was
before Southern Nigeria, and were somewhat
neglectful of the distant, isolated, and inaccessible
Northern territories. Nor were they wrong,
for the advance of its trade justified the most
sanguine predictions, and, as will be seen by a
glance at the appended tables (prepared in francs
by Mr. C. A. Birtwistle, the Commercial Intelligence
Officer of the Colony), its commerce to-day
practically equals the total of the French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Colonies of Senegal, Guinea, the Ivory Coast,
and Dahomey:—</p>

<p>It will be noted at a glance that whilst French
West African trade has increased by 65 per cent.,
that of Nigeria has grown by 136 per cent.</p>

<h3>ANTICIPATIONS OF NORTHERN NIGERIA’S FUTURE</h3>

<p>Northern Nigeria, however, was known to be
rich in iron, and the existence of other minerals
was suspected; its suitability as a field for the
exploitation of the cotton-growing industry was
realised and the British Cotton-Growing Association
reported a few years ago that “in Northern
Nigeria alone lies the possible salvation of Lancashire.”
Moreover, the Directors of the Niger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Company had always foretold the ultimate importance
that would be attained by the regions
north of the Niger and the Benue. The company’s
trade flourished in the south, new products
were being continually discovered and
new factories opened, and the optimism of its
shareholders was justified by the declaration of
substantial dividends, but Sir George Goldie
consistently predicted the boundless potentialities
of the unopened North, and as far back as 1889
declared: “We can hardly impress too strongly
upon our shareholders that our hopes of future
prosperity rest far less on the lower regions of
the Niger than upon the higher, inner, and recently
explored country.”</p>

<p>Sir Percy Girouard and others have warned the
public against confusing Northern and Southern
Nigeria, and running away with the idea that there
is no great difference between them. As Colonel
Mockler-Ferryman says: “Commencing with what
is called the Niger Delta, we have a land of swamps
and impenetrable forests, intersected by a vast
network of streams and creeks and inhabited by
numerous pagan tribes addicted to every species of
vile custom, including even cannibalism and human
sacrifices.... Above the pagan land—<i>i.e.</i>, at the
confluence [of the rivers Niger and Benue] there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
is a marked change, not only in the type of the
people but also in the nature of the country.
Mohammedan influence commences to show itself,
and low swampy wastes are superseded by rocky
hills or far-extending grassy plains, well studded
with magnificent trees.”</p>

<h3>NATIVE TIN WASHING</h3>

<p>The existence of alluvial tin in these Northern
regions was known for some considerable time,
but until a year or two ago its value as a
commercial asset was not seriously considered.
Rumours of such sources of wealth frequently
reached the Niger Company, and quantities of small
faggots of very pure metal, which occasionally
found their way down to the coast, afforded evidence
that the natives had been working and smelting tin
for a lengthy period. It was subsequently discovered
that the procedure adopted by the native
Nigerian tin miners, and described by Mr. Nicolaus,
is as follows:</p>

<p>“The washers, usually working in gangs of
three or four, wade into the river, tributary creeks
and gullies, generally at or near some shallow
rapids, and, loosening the gravel under water with
a short hoe-like implement, scoop it into large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
calabashes about 18 inches to 24 inches in diameter.
As soon as sufficient gravel is collected
(about 30 lbs.), it is washed, and the resulting
rough concentrate placed in a smaller calabash,
6 inches to 8 inches in diameter, and thoroughly
cleansed, nearly all the fine tinstone being lost.
The resulting ‘black tin’ containing the equivalent
of from 60 to 65 per cent. metal, is sun-dried,
and packed in bags and skins for transport to the
smelting furnaces.</p>

<p>“This ‘black tin’ is usually smelted in various
parcels on a royalty basis, exclusively by members
of one family, who hold the process a profound
secret. Only three native smelting furnaces are
in use, and these are each capable of turning out
about 2 cwt. of metal per diem. They are built
of well-puddled clay, and are 3 feet 6 inches in
diameter, and have at the back four tuyère holes
conducting the blast from primitive sheepskin
bellows to the hearth. The tin is reduced by
means of charcoal, and runs through a channel
2 feet 6 inches long and 4 inches broad to a
catch-pot, whence it is ladled by small gourds or
calabashes and poured. The tin is cast in the
form of thin bars of about an eighth of an inch
in diameter and 12 inches long, which are produced
by pouring the molten metal on semi-circular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
banks of clay, 18 inches high, perforated
by dry Guinea corn-halms.”</p>

<h3>THE DISCOVERY OF BAUCHI TIN</h3>

<p>The first actual discovery of tin in the Protectorate,
or the first conclusive evidence of its
actual existence there, has hitherto been ‘wrop
in mystery,’ but, thanks to the courtesy of
Sir William Wallace, late acting Governor of
Northern Nigeria, I am in a position to dispel
all uncertainty on the subject. In the course of
a letter I received from Sir William, dated 21st
October 1910, he says:—“Up to ’84 we used to
believe that the tin used by the Hausa people for
tinning their brass ware was brought across the
desert. I then, being busily engaged opening
up the Benue River to trade, got a hint that the
tin was being smelted in some of the Hausa
States, and, on making inquiries, found that it
was being produced in Bauchi. We did all
possible to develop the trade in the tin straws,
but with little success, as the pagan tribes would
have no dealings with the Hausa merchants,
and rightly so, as it would have only led to the
subjection of the tribes to the Fulani, whom they
kept at bay till our advent in 1902. Early in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
that year I went with the little army as Political
Agent to subdue the Emir of Bauchi, and after
settling that matter I was able to get messengers
through to the Delimi River, close to the
Naraguta, from whence they brought about a
quarter of a hundredweight of the tin sands, the
first ever procured or seen by Europeans. This
sample I brought home, and submitted to the
Directors of the Niger Company, who shortly
afterwards took out a prospecting licence over
1000 square miles. Since then, thanks principally
to Mr. Laws, the mining industry has slowly
forged ahead, until the rush came along this year.
Year in, year out, I have been urging companies
and encouraging prospectors to come along until
I almost despaired of success; but now, given
a railway to the tin field, the industry cannot
but prosper if the Government do not hamper
it with too many restrictions.”</p>

<h3>THE NIGER COMPANY’S EXPEDITION</h3>

<p>Sir William Wallace’s tribute to the work done
by Mr. Laws, the plucky and importunate mining
adviser of the Niger Company, is entirely merited.
The existence of paying tin was regarded with
some scepticism. It has also been surmised that
the officials and civil servants had too comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
berths to risk the disappointments and discomforts
of prospecting work. Moreover, the Niger Company
was in a flourishing condition, and its
directors were not anxious to launch into mining
enterprises. But Mr. Laws and his assistants
were indefatigable. In 1902 and 1903 three
expeditions were despatched to locate the tin areas.
The little party, under the protection of an armed
escort—for at that time the natives, now so
friendly, were somewhat hostile—proceeded to
make a geological examination of the country east
of the Niger, and eventually found tin in the
Province of Bauchi, some 600 miles to the north-east
of Lokoja. Further prospecting located the
stanniferous area to the outlines of the Gura
Mountains, a small range known as the Naraguta
and Shere Hills in the Badiko district of that
province.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST GEOLOGICAL REPORTS</h3>

<p>The geology of the area, as described by Mr.
R. C. Nicolaus, is composed of granites, igneous
intrusions of diabase and porphyry forming the
prominent peaks of the hill range. Near the
river a coarse grey gneiss forms a contact with
the granite, both of which rocks are traversed by
lenticles and gash veins of quartz, and several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
small igneous dykes cross diagonally the general
strike of country, which is north-east and dips
west.</p>

<p>Although the stream tin had so far only been
prospected in the neighbourhood of the rivers,
there was abundant evidence to show that the
source of the tin supply came from a stockwork
formation in the granite at the slopes and at the
base of the foot-hills. A somewhat remarkable
feature of this deposit was that a considerable
quantity of metallic tin was discovered under the
river banks during prospecting operations. It
was found in small grains and nodules about the
size of a bean, its surface very thinly coated
with only a trace of iron. It was very ductile,
and emitted, on crushing, the peculiar tin cry.
Its mode of occurrence in the gravels, associated
with coarse grains of stream tin at a depth of
some 15 feet under the surface, did not at first
allow its genesis being determinable, but it was
unhesitatingly put down as “native tin”—a mineral
up to that time of very rare occurrence.</p>

<h3>FIRST SHIPMENT OF TIN</h3>

<p>Mr. Laws and his engineers were so well satisfied
with their work, and the results they produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
were so encouraging, that the Niger Company
applied in 1905 for a number of mining leases in
selected areas. In spite of slight difficulties arising
from a scarcity of water in the dry season, a
considerable amount of development work was
accomplished, and the company secured an output
of one ton of black tin per diem. These results
proved that the gravels could be worked profitably,
while the geological structure of the country compelled
experts to the conclusion that the field
represented by far the most important discovery
of native tin that had been made. Further
examination of the district, which fully confirmed
the expectations raised by the first reports, has
inspired the prediction that this Northern Nigerian
tin field is perhaps the richest in the world.</p>

<p>The Niger Company continued to treat the
alluvial in the old primitive method, which consists
in the main of the use of calabash and sluice
boxes, by which they have, up to the present time,
secured over 1000 tons of black tin. Still, the
mineral resources of the colony were not, until
recently, appreciated in accordance with the
proved facts. Lord Scarborough year after
year had told the British public, in his annual
speech to the shareholders of the Niger Company,
that there was treasure in Northern Nigeria in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
the shape of alluvial tin. He told them, in March
1907, that during the previous fifteen months
roughly 240 tons of black tin, of the approximate
gross value of £30,000, had been obtained from one
property, the Naraguta, or an average of 16 tons
a month. He told his shareholders in 1908 that
the Niger Company had won £29,933 worth of
tin for that year. Last year he said: “As
regards tin development, we have brought home
and marketed an increased quantity of ore compared
with the previous year.” This year the
chairman of the Niger Company declared a 2s.
dividend per share as a result of the sale of a
small portion of their mining lands.</p>

<h3>OFFICIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEW FIELD</h3>

<p>The first official recognition of the importance
of the Bauchi tin deposits was conveyed to the
public in the Colonial Report on Northern Nigeria
in 1905, and in 1906 was published the First
Report on the Results of the Mineral Survey of
Northern Nigeria, 1904-5. “The mineral resource
of Northern Nigeria being virtually unknown”
(to quote the report), “a mineral survey
of the Protectorate to be carried out under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
general supervision of the Director of the Imperial
Institute by surveyors nominated by him, was
proposed by Sir F. Lugard, the High Commissioner
of Northern Nigeria, and sanctioned by
the Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1904.”
It was arranged that the officers of the Survey
should spend about eight months of each year in
Northern Nigeria in exploring the mineral deposits
of selected districts.</p>

<p>In the general introductory summary of the
first report of the surveyors, the prospects of the
tin fields of Northern Nigeria are described with
the customary official reserve. “Tin, in the
form of cassiterite,” the report stated, “has now
been found in the stream beds of other districts.
It is probable that as soon as suitable transport
is provided Northern Nigeria will become an
important tin-producing country. Already deposits
in the Bauchi Province are being worked
by the Niger Company, and the metal smelted on
the spot. The first consignment of tin from the
Protectorate has reached this country.”</p>

<p>The prospect presented by this information,
backed up by substantial shipments of tin, might
have been expected to stimulate the curiosity of
both prospectors and capitalists, and that other
Richmonds would have made an appearance in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the Bauchi field. But any hopes of such a result
were doomed to disappointment. The Niger Company
continued to win mineral, and the Mineral
Survey persisted in their efforts to prove the
extent of country over which the granites were
tin bearing. It is possible that the remoteness
and inaccessibility of the Protectorate operated
unfavourably in the minds of mining adventurers,
and the evil reputation which had been erroneously
given to the country may have moved financiers
to an excess of cautiousness. The colony made
no new friends, and, as will be shown later, it was
not until last year and then only by the accident
of failure in another direction, that capital was
diverted into the new tin field.</p>

<h3>TINSTONE CONCENTRATES ANALYSED</h3>

<p>Eleven specimens of tinstone concentrates from
the Zagi River, south of Bauchi, from Bula, Tilde,
and the river beyond Joss were forwarded to the
Imperial Institute, and with only one exception
were found upon analysis to contain tin in
quantities of from mere traces up to 80.85 per
cent, of tin oxide, equivalent to 63.5 per cent. of
metallic tin in the concentrate.</p>

<p>The official general remarks on the specimens
analysed were as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>“Most of the concentrates were obtained from
the plateaux of Tilde, Rukuba, Joss, and Ngell. On
the first three of these the principal surveyor reports
that the Niger Company has prospecting
camps. The finest grained tinstone is found on the
Tilde plateau, the coarser material coming from
Joss and Ngell. The tinstone is said to be irregularly
distributed, and adjoining pits may furnish
such different yields as 10 lbs., or less, and
400 lbs. per ton on gravel worked. The
average yield at the Rukuba camp is 25 lbs.
per ton. The present works, it is stated, are
all in the near neighbourhood of the river Delimi,
but it appears that the gravels are more or less
rich in tin over the whole surface of the plateau.
The river-beds in some cases contain valuable
tinstone-bearing gravels, as is shown by the
results of the analysis of the concentrate from
the river-bed at Tilde, which contained 68 per
cent. of tinstone. That from beyond Joss contained
only 40 per cent. of tinstone, possibly
owing to the difficulty of separating the ilmenite
from the tinstone by washing. The concentrate
from the Kende River consisted almost entirely
of ilmenite. The presence of the latter mineral
in the stream beds will introduce a difficulty in
the concentration of the tinstone, as it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
readily distinguishable by inspection from tinstone,
and collects with it in the first concentration.</p>

<p>“The results so far obtained show that tinstone
is widely distributed in the province of
Bauchi in the alluvium of both the high and low
plateaux. As these tinstone districts are in
process of being prospected, it is scarcely worth
while to discuss the commercial value of the tin
concentrates here, but it may be pointed out that
several of these concentrates contain monazite,
and this may be worth recovering. The amount
of monazite present is usually small, and it is
scarcely likely that its recovery under present
circumstances would pay for the working of an
electro-magnetic concentrator, which would be
required to effect its separation. If, however, it
becomes necessary to use such concentrators in
order to separate the ilmenite, which occurs with
the tinstone, then it would probably be worth
while to recover the monazite as a by-product.</p>

<p>“The question of the origin of the tinstone
occurring in this region is of great interest, and
the officers of the Survey propose to devote
further attention to the subject.”</p>

<p>The Colonial Report for 1907-8 carried us no
further, as the third Survey party which arrived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
in the country in December 1907 were still upon
their seven months expedition, and the results
of their work had not been received. The report
referred, however, to the fact that the Niger
Company, continuing its work on its licensed
area in the Bauchi Province, were exporting black
tin to the amount of 500 tons per annum, and
added: “The main difficulty in the development
of this promising industry is its situation. With
the construction of the railway through Zaria it
should be possible to place the mines in close
connection with it by means of a road, which
should also serve the Bauchi Province.”</p>

<h3>THE REPORTS OF EXPERTS</h3>

<p>In one of his reports on the Bauchi tin area,
Mr. Lush says:</p>

<p>“There is not the slightest doubt that before
very long many of the deep alluvial flats that
are some distance from the shallow and more
easily worked tin ground will be worked. The
values may turn out to be poorer than the shallow
ground, but the natural facilities are better owing
to the water supply being sufficient for continuous
working without the expense of erection of dams.
On the other hand, when you get out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
granite country, the further you are away from
the source of the tin the greater are the impurities
mixed with it. The numerous creeks,
after passing through the schists and other rocks
emptying into the main river, all tend to this, and
titanic iron, tourmaline, rutile, and gem sand
form a large percentage of the concentrates.
However, if on boring, the deep ground turns
out payable, there should be no difficulty in
getting rid of the impurities and dressing the tin
up to 70 per cent.”</p>

<p>Mr. L. H. L. Huddart, writing on this subject
in his report on the South Juga property,
says:</p>

<p>“<i>Sources of the Tin.</i>—The black tin is probably
derived from the granite of which it is a rock
constituent, and from stockworks in the granite
quartz porphyry occurs very similar to the
‘elvans’ in Cornwall.</p>

<p>“<i>Nature of the Wash.</i>—In the upper end the
wash is a fine whitish granite, containing no large
pebbles or boulders, and is near the original
source of some of the Juga tin. The surface is
slightly cemented with iron oxides in which
cassiterite often grows. The whole wash very
easily breaks down with water. The ground
further down the property is similar except that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the alluvial has travelled further, and consequently
has been sorted to a greater extent.</p>

<p>“Taken generally, the tin bearing is the product
of denudation from the granite of which the
bed-rock, and sides of the valley are composed.
The tin occurs in the wash right up against the
granite on both sides of the valley. The topaz
is abundant in the wash, and with some zircon
and rootile is almost the only mineral besides
cassiterite occurring in the concentrates.”</p>

<p>In his report on the Kurdum River Tin Concession,
Mr. Huddart says:</p>

<p>“<i>Geology.</i>—The base rock is a foliated gneiss
and schist; the great granite <i>massif</i> forming the
Jarawa Hills lies to the west of the property.
There is a good deal of granite on the property,
with some dolerite. The rocks are compact,
and show considerable signs of regional metamorphism.</p>

<p>“<i>Source of the Tin.</i>—The tin has been carried
down from the rich placers at the head water of
the Kurdum River, and form feeders that come
in above the property from the Jarawa and
Fuersum country. In one or two places the
natives work the river-bed, an indication in itself
of high value, as it does not pay them to work
any but rich gravel. The alluvial ground is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
quartz gravel with sand near the top. There is
very little clay, and long boulders are unlikely,
and the wash is friable and easy to work. The
river-bed gravel where coarse is very rich.</p>

<p>“<i>Concentrates.</i>—These contain usually minerals
such as ilmenite, rootile, zircon, and some topaz
and garnet. The tin is of good quality, and
varies in colour from black to ruby and pale
yellow. A little monazite is found, and an
occasional colour of gold. There should be no
difficulty in shipping concentrates that will assay
71 or 72 per cent. metallic tin. The tinstone
is of a good average size for saving in the sluice
boxes which can be given a good grade.”</p>

<h3>FRESH DISCOVERIES ANNOUNCED</h3>

<p>The Government Report on Northern Nigeria
for 1908-9 contained the announcement that
tin in paying quantities had been located in the
Provinces of Bauchi, Nassarawa, and on the
Kobba-Ilorin border, and this information has since
been supplemented by the Akerri (Nigeria) Tin
Company Ltd., which has taken up a tin area in
an entirely fresh district, one day’s journey west
of Zungeru, and one and a half day’s journey
north-east of Jebba.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a White Paper on “Nigeria,
September 1910,” issued in the following month
of October, we get an official reference to the
new tin industry:</p>

<p>“Mr. Parkinson states that in the Oban Hills,
Southern Nigeria, there are tourmaline pegmatites,
and Schmeisser has recorded that since the
discovery of an apparently rich tin deposit near
Banyo, there has been much prospecting for that
mineral in the Cameroons. Surface tin is found
in Northern Nigeria by the natives, and sold,
chiefly to the Niger Company, but mines on a
large scale have not as yet been worked. The
geological surveyors sent out by the Imperial
Institute have detected the presence of alluvial
tin in many sand and river gravels. At Uwet, in
Old Calabar, Mr. Parkinson reports the occurrence
of tinstone during the year 1906, and of the
washed samples 80 per cent. was tinstone, and
the remainder was garnet, tourmaline, quartz, and
columbite.”</p>

<h3>CONFIDENCE IN THE FIELD ESTABLISHED</h3>

<p>The Bauchi tin won by the Niger Company is
of rich quality, and commands a considerably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
higher price than ordinary English tin; but while
Lord Scarborough persistently told the public of
the results of their operations, mining was
not energetically proceeded with, and as has
been said the new field attracted less attention
than it deserved. But as prospecting work in
the district became more general, it was realised
from the virgin nature of the area, the cheapness
and abundance of labour available in the district,
and the enormous extent of the surface deposits,
that the regions were extremely valuable and
presented potentialities of great and continuous
profits. In the face of this later information the
first feeling of scepticism with which the discovery
was received passed away, doubt yielded to
confidence, and it was soon known that some of
the most astute and influential groups in the
City were interested in the exploitation of the
new field.</p>

<p>But although the future of the Bauchi tin
district was assured, it was necessary for some
one to be first in the systematic development of
the new field. Every report emanating from the
colony confirmed the story of the richness of
Nigerian tin, and a Royal Colonial Institute
address had admitted that “if the professional
reports were anything like approximately correct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
and the supply is regulated, a fabulous amount of
wealth is waiting to be extracted,” but the opportunity
to make fortunes out of Northern Nigeria
was neglected until the Champion Gold Reefs
of West Africa, Ltd., who had abandoned their
gold property on the Gold Coast, boldly threw
their remaining capital of £12,000 into the new
field.</p>

<h3>THE PIONEERS OF NORTHERN NIGERIAN TIN</h3>

<p>The credit, therefore, for placing the Nigerian
tin fields before the British investor is due to
Messrs. Walter and Oliver Wethered, and Mr.
S. R. Bastard. It was Mr. Walter Wethered, being
impressed by the large quantities of metal which
were being brought down by the natives and
sold to the Niger Company, who formed the
opinion that these fields might be suitable for
working on a large scale. Having satisfied
himself on this point he was able to induce Mr.
Bastard, and his brother, Mr. Oliver Wethered, to
join in the business, and as a result the Champion
Gold Reefs of West Africa, Ltd., of which Mr.
Bastard was Chairman, decided in the month of
September 1909 to embark its remaining capital
and all its energies in the exploitation of the new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Nigerian tin field. In October the first members
of their staff were sent out to the properties they
had already secured, to be followed on 3rd
November by Mr. C. G. Lush, the well-known
tin expert, who was to advise them as to the best
method of developing their properties. Everything
that happened satisfied this pioneer group of
the value of the field, and they formed the Tin
Fields of Northern Nigeria, Ltd., which was
registered on 7th October 1909, with a capital
of £100,000. Mr. Bastard became chairman of
this company.</p>

<p>The Nigerian Tin Corporation, Ltd., was registered
on 14th October 1909, with a capital
of £100,000. On this occasion Mr. Oliver
Wethered took the chairmanship. No further
company was floated during the year 1909, but
on 15th January 1910 this same group issued the
Naraguta (Nigeria) Tin Mines, Ltd., with a capital
of £175,000. This company has already, in the
few months it has been working, recovered over
300 tons of tin, and has declared its first
dividend. The next venture to be floated by the
Champion Gold Reefs company was the Northern
Nigerian (Bauchi) Tin Mines, Ltd., registered on
2nd February 1910, with a capital of £200,000,
of which Mr. Oliver Wethered became a director.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>The foregoing were the first five companies
registered for the sole purpose of working the
alluvial tin deposits of Northern Nigeria, and they
were all promoted by this pioneer group, comprising
Messrs. Walter and Oliver Wethered, and
Mr. S. R. Bastard. All these companies are doing
excellent work, and showing good results. After
February of this year others entered the field,
and since March last a large number of companies
and syndicates have been registered and formed,
several of which are at work.</p>

<p>It was only to be expected that such brilliant
results as these would have the effect of inducing
the more conservative firms to enter into the fields
of Northern Nigerian mineral enterprise, and now
Messrs. Wernher, Beit, the Consolidated Gold
Fields of South Africa, Fanti Consolidated, and many
other leading groups of bankers and capitalists
are represented in the Bauchi Province.</p>

<h3>THE INACCESSIBILITY OF THE FIELD</h3>

<p>But while the prospecting and actual mining
work being done on the Bauchi field are establishing
an ever-widening recognition of its mineral
wealth, its inaccessibility and the difficulties of
transport, which represent its chief drawbacks,
have not yet been overcome, and it may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
opportune to explain here the methods of transport
employed in the two Nigerias, to describe the
railway system, and to give some ideas of the difficulties
of carriage with which the mine owners of
Northern Nigeria have to contend.</p>

<p>Southern Nigeria, through which the Northern
Protectorate is reached from the coast, is covered
with a network of waterways, which are the
natural transport roads of the entire region, and
the Marine Department is continually surveying
old and overgrown streams and opening up new
river routes. It is possible, travelling by the
Niger River from Forcados to the confluence at
Lokoja, and following from that point the Benue
River to Loko, to arrive within about 180 miles
of Bauchi, or going by rail from Lagos to Jebba,
the present northern terminus of the line, to get,
as the crow flies, within 300 miles of that centre.
The river route is obviously the quickest and
cheapest, and is the one still in use, the natives
carrying the tin in parcels of 60 lbs. weight
on their heads from the field to Loko, travelling
about 15 miles a day. At Loko, the metal is
put into small steamers or barges, according to the
season, and conveyed to the confluence, where
it is transferred to Niger boats and taken to
Forcados for shipment to Liverpool, the entire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
journey occupying thirty-five days and costing
£29 10s. per ton.</p>

<h3>COST OF TRANSPORT</h3>

<p>When the construction of the Kano Railway
from Baro on the Niger to railhead is opened, and
the road connecting the railway to Bauchi is
made, the journey will be appreciably shortened.
The completion of the railway from Lagos in 1911
should further reduce it to about twenty-eight days,
and again when motors are available on the new
road, to about three weeks.</p>

<p>The cost per ton by the Forcados-Baro route
will be:—</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>£</th>
    <th><i>s.</i></th>
    <th><i>d.</i></th>

<p>This will be increased when the maximum
rate is charged, and will be reduced when the
motor transport on the new road is available.</p>

<h3>THE RAILWAYS OF NIGERIA</h3>

<p>The future cost and time of transport depends
upon the completion of the railway construction at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
present in hand, and the decision of the Government
with regard to the suggested new line to
connect the tin fields with some selected spot
upon the Baro-Kano line of railway. The Lagos
railway to Jebba in Northern Nigeria is 307
miles in length, but although the last constructed
stretch of 60½ miles from Ilorin was only opened
in August last, the line has already been continued
for some 50 miles beyond the Niger, and the
balance of 70 miles to be completed to Zungeru,
the capital of Northern Nigeria, is expected to be
finished early in the coming year. By this
route, when the connecting line from Zungeru to
the Baro-Kano railway is constructed, and the
branch from the latter railway to Bauchi is built,
it will be possible to carry machinery all the
way from Lagos to the new field by train, and
bring the metal down to the port by the same
service.</p>

<p>But although this Lagos railway, as it is still
called, taps a fertile and thickly populated country
and connects the capital of the north with the
coast, it became, with the commencement of the
new Baro-Kano line the second, instead of the
first, most important factor in the development
of Northern Nigeria. Until the year 1907 the
Northern Protectorate possessed in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
railways but one light 2 feet 6 inch tramway
of 22 miles in length, which connected its capital,
Zungeru, with Baro, the nearest navigable point on
the river.</p>

<p>It was in May 1907 that Sir Percy Girouard,
the Governor, whose name had already become
famous in connection with his splendid railway
work in the Sudan and in South Africa, formulated
the railway policy, and recommended the construction
by the Public Works Department of
the Protectorate of a 3 feet 6 inch gauge railway
from Baro, on the Niger River, to Kano, a
distance of a little short of 400 miles, on an
estimate of £3000 per mile. In August of the
same year the Imperial Government sanctioned the
construction of the proposed line.</p>

<p>At the same time the views of the administrative
Southern Protectorate were met by the
extension of the Lagos line into Northern Nigeria,
with a connection to be established from Zungeru
with the Baro-Kano railway, making it possible to
travel from Kano either all the way by rail to
the coast at Lagos, or by rail to Baro, and thence
by river steamers to the mouth of the Niger. It
is expected that the bulk of the exports will follow
the line to Baro, and thence be carried to the sea
by water transport, but the Lagos line serves such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
a rich and well populated country, that when the
Port of Lagos has been rendered accessible by
the harbour improvements now in construction,
the line should prove of increasing economic value,
quite apart from any trade it may attract from the
more easterly provinces of Northern Nigeria.</p>

<h3>NEW LINE ADVOCATED</h3>

<p>The Baro-Kano railway was put in hand at
an extremely opportune time, and it was while the
work of construction was being rapidly pushed
forward that the discovery of tin in the Bauchi
Province turned the thoughts of railway construction
in an easterly direction, and the continuous
and consistently rich finds which rewarded
the efforts of prospectors in this region called
daily and hourly attention to its remoteness. At
first it was considered that the formation of a
good road from Bauchi to strike the Baro-Kano
line about Zaria would suffice for the needs of the
field, but the extraordinary extent and richness of
the deposits, and the phenomenal success achieved
by the Naraguta (Nigeria) Tin Mines, Ltd., the
Lucky Chance Mines, Ltd., and other companies at
work there, emphasised the self-evident fact that
nothing less than a branch railway would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
sufficient to adequately develop the new industry.
London capitalists expressed their willingness to
find the money to finance the new line, but the
question was, and still is, under the consideration
of the Colonial Office, and Sir Walter Egerton, the
Governor of Southern Nigeria, and Sir Hesketh Bell,
the High Commissioner of Northern Nigeria, and
Sir William Wallace, the late acting Governor of
that colony, all strongly favour the construction of
the line by the Government rather than by private
enterprise.</p>

<h3>SIR WALTER EGERTON’S OPINIONS</h3>

<p>Sir Walter Egerton, in an interview he granted
to a Press representative in June last, said:
“Everybody believes the tin deposits to be very
rich, and if only half the reports concerning them
are true, there is more than enough to warrant
the expenditure of making a branch to the tin
fields of the Province of Bauchi. This would give
direct access from the sea at Lagos to the tin
fields. The reports show that the tin alluvial is
similar to that of the Malay Peninsula, which produces
more than half the tin of the world.
Southern Nigeria has already lent the money
required for the construction of the railway to
Kano, and it is a question for the consideration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
of the Secretary of State whether we should not
also finance the building of the line to the tin
areas. I should think it would be a great advantage
to Southern Nigeria to have such communication,
as a large traffic might be expected.
If the Secretary of State agrees, there is no
reason to expect that there will be any opposition
in Southern Nigeria to financing the line, for the
success of the tin industry will have a wonderful
effect not only on Northern, but also on Southern
Nigeria, for the Protectorates, though two politically,
are one geographically.”</p>

<h3>THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PROJECTED LINE</h3>

<p>Since this interview was published it has been
persistently rumoured that the Government have
decided to build the suggested line from a point
near Rigachiko, on the Baro-Kano line, to a place
called Toro, between 120 and 130 miles distant,
in the centre of the tin district, and midway
between Naraguta and Juga. The country which
the line would traverse has been surveyed, and a
new road, 12 feet wide throughout, and capable of
conveying light motor traffic in the dry season is
being constructed, and will probably be completed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
before the end of the present year. But the
Government have not yet announced their decision,
and it is doubtful, although efforts have been
made to induce them to divert the funds for extending
the line from Zaria to Kano for the purpose
of the tin fields branch, whether they can be
persuaded to do so. It is believed, as Sir Walter
Egerton said, that if the Government acts on the
recommendation of the Governor of Northern
Nigeria, the Government of Southern Nigeria
would be willing to undertake the construction
of the line, and should the Colonial Office decline
to sanction the scheme, representatives of several
of the companies interested in the new tin field
have expressed their readiness to finance the
railway.</p>

<p>As recently as October 22nd a meeting of representatives
of the various Northern Nigerian tin
companies was held at the London Offices of the
Niger Company, when a general committee, to be
named the Northern Nigerian Mines Association,
was formed, composed of a representative of each
of the companies, and a sub-committee, composed
of Lord Scarborough, Mr. S. R. Bastard, Mr.
O. Wethered, Mr. Godfrey, and Mr. Berry was
appointed to deal with urgent business. The chief
attention of this meeting was naturally paid to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the question of transport, and the first business
done was the passing of a resolution urging the
Colonial Office to construct the railway to the
Bauchi tin fields as early as possible. The
Association decided on the appointment of a
medical officer, and they have, furthermore, given
instructions for a hospital to be built on the field
at Joss. It will therefore be seen that everything
possible is being done to urge upon the Government
the importance of pushing forward this
work, which will doubtless be taken seriously in
hand before long.</p>

<h3>VARIOUS OPINIONS</h3>

<p>Everybody connected with the Protectorate or
interested in the new tin field is agreed as to the
absolute necessity of constructing the line.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Tomson, the chief engineer of the
Anglo-Continental Mines Company, who recently
returned to England after an extended tour in the
Bauchi district, declared that the difficulties of
transport are at present tremendous, but he is
of opinion that they could best be overcome
by running a railway from Minna, a point on
the Baro-Kano line to Naraguta, the capital of
Bauchi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>“Before I left,” said Mr. Tomson to a representative
of the <i>Morning Post</i>, “I had an interview
with Sir Hesketh Bell, the Governor, and found
him most sympathetic towards the mining industry.
He recognises that the railway should
be built to the tin fields as quickly as possible,
but of course it is a question of ways and means.
If the Colonial Office came to the rescue and
made a special grant for laying the line, or else
allowed the united mining companies to construct
it themselves, which they are quite willing to do,
all would be well. But it is important that something
should be done at once. If not, there is
going to be a serious difficulty over the food
supply, because so many mining companies have
gone to the Bauchi district that the farmers are
unable to cope with the demand for food. With
a railway to Minna and then along the line now
being laid to Zungeru, which connects up the
Lagos railway and the line from Baro, the ore
would reach port in a few days.”</p>

<p>Mr. Beresford, the Secretary of the Administration
of Northern Nigeria, in an official letter
written to a correspondent, discussing new means
of transport in the Protectorate, says:— “A
survey for a road has just been completed, and it
has been found that the Rishi Pass is not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
practicable line, and it is considered that Toro
or Tilde, and not Liruei, should be the point of
objective. It is hoped that by December next
a rough road, fit for carts or light motors, may
be completed to Toro <i>via</i> the Gusu Pass, but the
Governor is strongly of opinion that nothing but
a railway will suit the requirements of the tin
fields, even in the near future, and he hopes that
it may be possible to find funds for such a
project.”</p>

<h3>THE ROUTE DESCRIBED</h3>

<p>When the work of seeing these pages through
the press was nearing completion, a letter arrived
at the London offices of the Tin Fields of
Northern Nigeria, Ltd., from their engineer,
Mr. Jerome J. Collins, describing the means of
transport from the coast to the seat of operations
in the Bauchi Province. The particulars, which
are given from personal experience of the journey,
are both interesting and instructive, as they are
also the last word to hand on the subject, and
the excerpts which follow are published by the
courtesy of the directors of the company, by whom
the letter was received.</p>

<p>Writing from Kogin Jarawa, under date
September 13, Mr. Collins says:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p><i>Niger River Transport.</i>—Forcados to Baro.</p>

<p>The distance is 407 miles. The Niger Company,
Ltd., and the Government run shallow
draught steamers carrying passengers and cargo.
The Government steamers run a weekly service
in connection with the mail steamers from Liverpool.
The Niger Company run steamers as
inducement offers.</p>

<p>The time occupied is about ten days by both
services, but a great deal of this time is taken up
with stoppages at the various towns along the
river.</p>

<p>The Government steamers are in a very bad
state of repair, and much time is lost owing to
breakdowns. In the rainy season branch
steamers travel between the coast and Baro, at
present carrying railway material. They have
facilities for handling heavy cargo.</p>

<p>The season extends from July to September.</p>

<p>The Government and Niger Company’s boats
have no facilities for handling heavy cargo, being
limited to packages capable of being handled by
native labour, which is tedious and expensive.</p>

<p>The cost of transport by Government steamers
for ordinary cargo from Forcados to Baro is from
40s. to 60s., and down from Baro to Forcados is
from 21s. to 33s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p><i>Railway Transport.</i>—Baro to Rigachiko.</p>

<p>The distance is 225 miles. The railway is
not yet completed to Rigachiko, where the Bauchi
road starts, but I understand from railway
officials that the line will be through by next
March, 1911. Railhead at present is at Kogin
Serikin Pawa, 172 miles from Baro, but rails are
laid to within fifteen miles of Rigachiko, and this
part of the line will be ready as soon as the
bridges are completed.</p>

<p>The railway is 3 feet 6 inch gauge, and has
been constructed with economy always in view.
Up to the present there is no ballast on the line,
and consequently there are serious delays during
the rainy season owing to derailment of engines
and the washout of embankments. My journey
from Baro to railhead occupied fifteen days; the
most of this time was lost owing to breakdowns
on the line.</p>

<p>The journey should occupy two days, and I
have no doubt that by March next it will be
possible to get from Baro to Rigachiko in two
days.</p>

<p>The freight on the line at present is 8s. per
ton per mile, equal to £7 10s. per ton from
Baro to Rigachiko, but at present the railway
company will not undertake to transport cargo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
unless it is accompanied, and even then they will
take no responsibility.</p>

<p>I understand that in the next year, when the
railway is open to Zaria, the freight will be
reduced to 6s. per ton per mile, equal to
£5 12s. 6d. per ton from Baro to Rigachiko.</p>

<p><i>Road Transport.</i>—Rigachiko to Naraguta.</p>

<p>The distance is approximately 135 miles. On
my journey across by this road I took eight days,
which is as quick as can be expected.</p>

<p>The Government engineers are clearing a track
twelve feet wide, and pulling out tree stumps.
They are also grading down banks of creeks to
one in ten.</p>

<p>They are expending £20 per mile on this work,
and have completed fifty miles in two months.</p>

<p>This road track will come into the tin fields at
Toro, twelve miles north-east of Naraguta, and
twelve miles west of the company’s property at
Federri. This track should be finished by the
end of the year.</p>

<p>The country is flat and very easy for road
building. There are four large rivers to cross,
which would require bridges of over 100 feet in
length, and numerous small creeks which could be
bridged cheaply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>There is plenty of stone suitable for road
ballast, available near the road. When the road
track is through to the tin fields it will be possible
to transport stores by carrier in seven days from
railway.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned here that the Niger
Company up to the present have had great
difficulty with the prospectors and others travelling
up to the tin fields, owing, in some cases, to
their not having left themselves entirely in the
hands of the company. The Niger Company
have practically controlled the country, and have
perfected arrangements by which they can supply
large numbers of natives for carrying goods
from the river to the tin field, but on several
occasions their organisation has been interfered
with by persons offering the natives three or four
times their usual pay in order to get them
through quickly to the fields. This, of course,
as will be seen, is a dangerous policy, for if a scale
is not strictly adhered to, the time will come
when the natives will start attempting to dictate
their own terms.</p>

<p>The Niger Company are not in favour of the
motor route from the head of the Baro-Kano to
the fields. Their opinion is that the money
would be wasted on such a road, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
mining community should be satisfied to wait
until the railway is made. Their view is that
the mining companies should join together and
come to an arrangement with the Niger Company
for carrying all the goods along their own route
from Loko to the field <i>via</i> Keffi and Bukeru.
This road, they say, could be reserved for mining
business, and they would open up another route,
starting from a point near Sinkai higher up the
Benue River, which could be used for ordinary
commercial purposes. They point out that with
the rush of goods required for the mines, they
have been unable to get up a sufficient and proper
supply of provisions. This question, of course,
requires careful consideration, as although the
Niger Company wish to be considered as offering
this advice in a purely disinterested manner, it
should be remembered that they are asking for
contracts for the whole of the transport, which
would enable them to employ thousands of natives
at a very low figure.</p>

<h3>THE BAUCHI PROVINCE</h3>

<p>Meantime the energetic prospecting and mining
work that is being done in the Province of Bauchi
is establishing the fact that the new tin area is of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
enormous extent and value both in the nature of
alluvial gravels and the more permanent form
of tin lodes. Mr. Lush, the well-known mining
authority, who has examined a great part of the
Province, estimates that these deposits are
scattered over an area of no less than 2,500
square miles, and the tin produced is considered
to be some of the best ever imported into Europe,
and commands a price equal, if not higher, than
the Straits tin. The land is situated about 3,000
to 4,000 feet above sea-level, and the late
Director of Mines in Northern Nigeria states that
the climate is equal to that of Rhodesia, if not
even better.</p>

<p>“Few people have any idea,” Mr. Tomson
asserts, “of the possibilities of this country. It
is quite a mistake to think it is unhealthy.
Naraguta is over 3,500 feet above the sea-level,
and is a healthy and fertile district. Here you are
hundreds of miles away from the malarial swamps
and the coast. If you walk up out of the town
of Naraguta on to rising ground, as far as you
can see stretch out great plains of waving grass,
here and there dotted with masses of the Fulani
cattle. It would make a splendid wheat-growing
district, for the land requires very little cultivation,
and there is no bush country. Kano, which lies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
nearly two hundred miles to the north, is a remarkable
place. Several travellers have stated
that it is the largest market in the world.”</p>

<h3>CLIMATE AND WATER</h3>

<p>Mr. Huddart, until recently Director of Mines,
who has declared that the climate of Northern
Nigeria is better than that of Rhodesia, and that the
country is without a single tsetse belt, says:</p>

<p>“The nights are quite cold, and any man who
lives well ought to have perfect health. I do not
reckon it in the least like any other part of West
Africa; it is more like Eastern Soudan, and it is
known as the Western Soudan. With regard to
water, which, as you know, is a very important
question, it is quite erroneous to imagine that
there is very little water here. In Northern
Queensland and South-Eastern and Western
Australia there is much less water than here; in
fact there is no comparison between them. Mr.
Lush and I—and I had the pleasure of travelling
with him—were never at any trouble in getting
water, we never had even to carry water, and
those who have travelled know what that means.”</p>

<p>In Nigeria they have only two well-defined
seasons, the wet and the dry season. The wet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
season lasts from April till the end of October,
and during that time it is very difficult to do any
prospecting work, although, of course, mining can
be carried on in certain districts. It is during
the dry season, from the end of October to April,
that most of the work can be accomplished,
especially from a prospector’s point of view.</p>

<h3>LIVING AND PROVISIONS</h3>

<p>Mr. Lush, writing on the subject of the cost
of living and provisions, says “living is cheap,
there being plenty of beef, mutton, fowls, milk,
eggs, &amp;c. Any kind of vegetable grows well,
especially English varieties; in fact very few
mining fields that I have visited can be compared
to Northern Nigeria in respect of the various
sorts of wholesome fresh food that can be
obtained. In fact all one requires is flour and a
few groceries. The country will provide the rest.”</p>

<h3>LICENCES AND LEASES</h3>

<p>The new mining regulations, incorporated in
the “Minerals Proclamation, 1910,” have already
been published in Nigeria, but they are not yet
obtainable in this country, and I am privileged
to be able to reproduce a copy of them as an
appendix to this book. From this document it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
will be seen that a prospector must either take
out a prospecting right, which costs £5 per
annum, and entitles the holder to explore for
minerals in those parts of the Protectorate not
already leased or reserved by Government notice,
or an exclusive licence to prospect within an area
not exceeding 16 square miles for a fee of £5
per square mile. Mining leases are only granted
to holders of either one of these permits, who,
upon application, must show that <i>bonâ fide</i> prospecting
operations have been carried on on the
area applied for, and that they possess or command
sufficient working capital to ensure the proper
development and working of the mine. Leases
of tin areas, which are granted for a term up to
twenty-one years, with the option to renew for
a further twenty-one years, are three in number,
viz., lode mining leases, which may be obtained
up to a maximum of thirty claims of 80,000
square feet per claim, at the rental of £4 per
claim per annum; alluvial mining leases, not
exceeding 800 acres in area, with a minimum
width throughout of 400 yards, at a rate of 5s.
per acre per annum; and stream mining leases,
which shall be confined to the bed of a stream,
not exceeding one mile in length, at a rental of
£1 per 100 yards per annum. Penalties in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
shape of fines or imprisonment are to be inflicted
for prospecting without a licence or working a mine
without a lease, for interfering with a prospector
in the exercise of his rights, for giving false information
in an application for a mining lease, or
for “salting” a mine, and the Government reserve
the power to cancel a prospecting right or revoke
a mining lease for certain breaches of the new
regulations. Over and above the fees charged
for yearly rental of leases, the holder is by
statute required to pay a royalty of 5 per cent.
to the Niger Company on the value of all
metal won, and another royalty of 5 per cent.
to the Government, who collect their royalty in
the form of export duty.</p>

<h3>LABOUR</h3>

<p>A population estimated at seven to nine
millions is already on the land, and although their
labour would not be very efficient so far as
skilled work is concerned, there is plenty of rough
work to be done, for which about 6d. per day is
paid. The costs of treatment are not expected to
exceed 6d. per cubic yard. When it is remembered
that it is possible for one property to
contain many hundreds of thousands of cubic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
yards of alluvial wash, and that this alluvial
tinstone is worth approximately 10d. per lb. at
the present time, it will be realised that with the
working costs at the liberal figure of 6d. per cubic
yard, there is a very considerable margin of profit
in these undertakings.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Tomson says of the natives that they
make very good labourers: “They insist on
being paid with English money, ‘threepenny bits’
being very popular. They have no liking for
gold, and do not consider it so valuable as silver.
The pagans, who are the farming class, appear to
be a most industrious people. They still live in
fear of invading Fulani, and always take their
bows and arrows with them to the field. Neither
men nor women wear dress of any kind. They
have a juju or secret oath which forbids them to
put on any garment. With these people the
missionaries make no headway at all. Neither
do they with the Mohammedans.”</p>

<p>The manager of the Lucky Chance Mines,
reporting under date 29th August, said he
was still paying 6d. per day for ordinary
labour, and so far he had had little trouble
with the men on day wages, although they
had several times tried to get him to raise
the rate of pay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>Reporting on a property at Juga in the tin
district, Mr. Huddart says:</p>

<p>“The properties are very favourably situated
to obtain labour. The men from Bauchi and the
east come along the main caravan route looking
for work to enable them to earn money to pay
the taxes, &amp;c. As this particular property is near
the market, and the men usually halt at the market,
they can easily be recruited. The cost of ordinary
labour is 1d. per hour, and is easily trained. The
Bornu and Eastern Kanuri are, in my opinion,
the best workers available. A further advantage
lies in the position of the property in settled
country under the control of the Filani Emir of
Bauchi, and the men prefer this to the pagan
country.”</p>

<p>Referring to another property about twenty
miles further south, Mr. Huddart says:</p>

<p>“When all is in proper working order, I am
convinced that ample labour will be forthcoming,
as the property is favourably situated in that it
can tap the Angass country and the western
part of Bornu, as well as the eastern Bauchi
territory. When the proper camps are made,
markets organised, and the natives learn that a
certain income awaits them, I feel sure that labour
will come in without any difficulty, and I speak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
as one knowing their language and having an
intimate knowledge of the conditions.”</p>

<p>Mr. H. W. Laws, General Mining Manager
of the Niger Company, in his report to the Bisichi
Company, whose property is near Naraguta, says:</p>

<p>“There is a good supply of labour in the
country; owing to a sudden increase in the
demand for labour a temporary shortage was
reported this wet season, but the labour market
is now rapidly recovering, and in view of the
very large amount of labour available in the
Hausa States, and the Province of Bornu, no
difficulties need be anticipated as to the supply
in future.”</p>

<p>The concensus of opinions held by men who
understand the amount and nature of the work
entailed in this particular form of mining, and
are, at the same time, personally familiar with
the material that the country has to offer for
the purpose, shows that the supply of labour
in Northern Nigeria is entirely adequate, and
although the development of West Africa depends
almost entirely upon the labour question, there
is no prospect of any difficulty on this account.
Mr. Astley Cooper believes the chief grounds
upon which trouble might arise, are the desire
of the majority of the natives not to do too much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
work, the fear that a few months’ work in the
mines would give a native sufficient money to live
on for a year or two, and the difficulty of getting
the right sort of European to take charge of the
native labourers. But after all there is little
reason to anticipate trouble on any one of these
counts. No native in any part of the globe does
more work than he is kindly but firmly obliged
to perform, and there is no necessity for employers
to demoralise the native labourers by a
policy of over-payment. But the necessity of
employing the right sort of European to put in
control over the natives is quite to the point.
The West African is more domestic than the
Kaffir—of whom there are over 200,000 at work
in the Transvaal mines—and there is no more
willing worker if he has the proper white man
over him. But it is the duty of the Government
and the trading companies, and the mining corporations,
to select the right men for their purpose,
and if they are wise in this respect there need
be no fear of labour troubles in either Southern
or Northern Nigeria.</p>

<h3>THE FUTURE OF THE FIELD</h3>

<p>The published opinions of Government officials,
engineers of repute, capitalists, traders, and travellers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
all tend to prove that in Northern Nigeria we
have one of the largest, if not the very largest,
of the tin-producing areas of the world. Other
minerals are known to exist, and very big developments
may be looked for in the near future, as
the pioneering efforts of the Niger Company and
the Champion Gold Reefs of West Africa are being
followed by powerful financial houses, but alluvial
tin stands out, and will always stand out, as the
leading product of this remarkable mineral country.</p>

<p>Two such astute men and persons so well acquainted
with the country as Sir Walter Egerton,
the Governor of Southern Nigeria, and the late
Sir Alfred Jones, have expressed the strongest
views as to the extent and importance of these
tin deposits, and the acting Governor of Northern
Nigeria in his latest report asserted that “with
the introduction of more capital and a good means
of transport from the field to the railway a very
large development is anticipated.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lush says the Bauchi tin deposits are
richer than he has seen in any part of the world.
It is, he says, a granite country, and although the
existence of reefs has been proved in one part of
the district, the alluvial deposits—which yield tin
oxide containing about 72 per cent. of metallic
tin—are of principal importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<h3>ALLUVIAL AND LODE MINING</h3>

<p>Alluvial mining, has, of course, the demerit of
being short-lived. There is no great depth in
the deposits, and especially if they are worked
economically—that is to say rapidly—they are
exhausted in a comparatively short time. But
the attention directed to the district in these
alluvial workings will certainly lead to the discovery
and opening-up of the tin lodes, which in
course of time should prove a more lasting source
of supply than the alluvials. Indeed, at two
points, two tin lodes are already being opened up,
and before long a good idea should be obtained
of their value. The interests at work in the
district will certainly see that every chance is
given to this side of the business, but, of course,
development upon a lode is very different work to
that upon alluvial deposits, and progress may be
slower in their case. It is very unlikely, with
such an enormous area of stanniferous gravels,
that lodes of importance should not be discovered
as time goes on, and there appears to be no doubt
that the tin production of Nigeria will become
quite a factor in the markets of the world. Many
things will have to happen before lode producing
can be carried out upon a large scale, but as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
alluvials are worked out, the labour employed
upon them can be concentrated upon the most
lasting deposits, and the operations of the alluvial
miners should produce a working population which
should be fitted to deal with the higher form of
mining. Certain facilities will doubtless be given
to the district, and some idea of the importance
and the developments in this part of Nigeria can
be gathered from the fact that the Bank of British
West Africa has been earnestly invited to open
an office in Bauchi. At present this matter is
under consideration, since it is difficult to fix upon
a spot which will be most suitable for such an
institution to work, but before long it is probable
that the tin-mining district will have the facilities
offered by a bank.</p>

<h3>THE GENERAL PROSPECTS</h3>

<p>Mr. Oliver Wethered, whose name is so well
known in connection with the tin industry, has
described to a meeting of shareholders the peculiar
advantages of the country which is now attracting
the attention of the tin markets of the world, and
in the course of his address he said:</p>

<p>“Now as to the country in which our interests
are centred, judging by the information that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
have received from all available quarters, I have
no hesitation in stating that we are interested in
one of the most important virgin alluvial tin fields
the world has ever seen, and certainly the most
important that capitalists have had an opportunity
of working as a new field. In Tasmania,
Australia, and other countries which have produced
large quantities of alluvial tin, the prospectors
have gone in by hundreds, and even
thousands, and have washed out large quantities
of tin greatly to their own individual benefit.
Subsequently the ground has been worked over
and over again, and in recent years again re-worked
by means of modern appliances. I may
say here, that in Cornwall some of the ground
must have been worked eight or ten times, and
big plants are now being erected for the purpose
of working it again by modern methods. It will
be obvious to every one that with a practically
untouched field, and working in the most economical
and thorough way from the start, the results
cannot fail to be extremely satisfactory.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly one of the factors which has
delayed the opening up of the tin fields of Nigeria
has been the question of economical transport.
But the Nigeria tin is of very high quality. It
fetches, as a rule, anywhere from £6 to £8<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
more a ton than Cornish tin, and in this connection
I should like to read an extract from a letter
which was written to me by the managing director
of the largest tin smelting works in Europe, to
whom I sent a sample of the tin oxide as it was
received here, and of which, in acknowledging it,
he says, ‘It is about 75 per cent. metallic tin, of
excellent quality, equal to anything being put on
the market, so far as my observation goes.’ I am
very closely connected with Cornish mining, and
there we get Bolivian, Straits, and all kinds of
tin, and it is the general opinion that Nigerian
tin is one of the very best tins imported into
Europe, and will always command a price equal
to, if not better than, that of the Straits. Even
under existing conditions alluvial tin mining in
Nigeria is a highly profitable business, but when
the present railway system is completed, and the
road made from the Government line to the tin
field, the freight should be reduced by many
pounds per ton, and the profit largely increased.
The completion of the road would enable heavy
machinery to be brought to the mines, when
larger quantities of the rich alluvial ground
would be handled in an economical way, and
the work done at a cost much below what is
possible under existing conditions. The lodes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
too, of which there is undoubted evidence, could
be worked. Meanwhile some machinery can be
transported in sections, and the output of tin
should be rapidly increased and the costs greatly
reduced.”</p>

<p>Mr. Assheton Lever, in summing up the
situation generally in Northern Nigeria to a
meeting of shareholders, said:</p>

<p>“We know that there are considerable areas
there which in some cases are very rich in
alluvial tin. There are also tin lodes there;
but that for the present is another story, because
alluvial tin is a thing which is easily and comparatively
inexpensively worked, whereas to work
a lode mine requires good means of transport,
and to be able to get up to the mines easily
expensive and heavy machinery. We have a
good climate, we have a sufficiency of water,
and so far as we can ascertain, we have
a sufficiency of native labour. All the companies
which are interested in Northern
Nigeria appear anxious to co-operate, and are
willing to work together generally for their
mutual benefit, and for the tin industry in
particular.”</p>

<p>Mr. H. W. Lake, the consulting engineer,
speaking in a professional capacity at the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
meeting, referred to the phenomenal richness of
the river banks in the tin district in Northern
Nigeria, while very rich alluvials are found on
the flats, and when it comes to investigation
of the river banks themselves very much larger
quantities of black tin to the cubic yard are won.
“I am speaking now,” he added, “from a certain
amount of experience, because four years ago
we had an expedition in the Bauchi district, and
our engineer obtained some quite remarkable
results from the alluvial. Of course, it is a
new country. There is a great deal of pioneering
work to be done, and what we have still to
look forward to is steady systematic organisation
for the next year or two. We do not want to
make the mistakes that have been made in the
opening up of many new countries—some of
them not very far from Nigeria—but we do want
to settle down to steady systematic development.
As far as the railway is concerned, there
seems no doubt that we shall have a line into
the tin fields, which is going to simplify the
question of transport, and reduce the costs very
materially. With regard to the actual working
of these alluvials, to begin with, I am of
opinion that we should use the simplest methods
possible—ground sluicing and so forth, but there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
will come a time when we shall have very
seriously to consider the question of hydraulicing
and treating these alluvials on a very much
larger scale than would be possible by means of
sluicing.”</p>

<h3>A DISTRICT FULL OF NARAGUTAS</h3>

<p>The extraordinary results obtained by the
Naraguta Company might be regarded as exceptional,
since it was a proved mine when taken
over from the Niger Company, and the actual
work done upon it has only confirmed what was
previously known of its phenomenal value. But
it may be said with great confidence, after careful
examination, by not one, but many engineers,
that the picture is not in any degree overdrawn.
Moreover, the head of a great firm of mining
engineers who was inclined to ridicule the values
reported, has since admitted that he has altogether
changed his opinion, and that he thinks
from advices he has received, that the Malay
Peninsula fields, even in their palmiest days,
were never “in it” with the Northern Nigerian
alluvial tin fields. In one place tin has been
taken out, on the Dubbo property, belonging to
the Lucky Chance Mines, extending over 640<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
acres, which actually goes 120 lbs. to the cubic
yard. That is to say, that the calabashers must
be getting out tin almost pure. This may be
only a pocket; but the whole character of the
reports from the fields makes it perfectly certain
that the general nature of the Bauchi district,
where the alluvial tin is mostly found, is of an
absolutely phenomenal character.</p>

<p>There is no doubt whatever that in this remote
district of Nigeria, which until a few years ago,
was closed to the white man by the ferocity of
its inhabitants, nature has been concentrating tin
for thousands and tens of thousands of years,
until we have it now in very large quantities in
an almost pure condition. To Sir Percy Girouard
is largely due the honour of opening up this
country, through the discipline he and his subordinates
dealt out to the original inhabitants.
To his successor, Sir Hesketh Bell, fell the duty
and the honour of opening up further the country
by a railway system which will make it a great
Imperial acquisition.</p>

<p>The work of Sir Percy Girouard and Sir
Hesketh Bell may be specially referred to, for
they represent the Imperial Government; but we
must not forget the work of the directors of the
pioneer companies in London, who must have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
worked continually to do what they have done.
In the short space of only twelve months they
have accomplished an amount of work which
ordinary directors without enthusiasm would
have taken years to do. The country has been
searched for good properties, engineers have been
despatched and machinery ordered, and such is
the good work done in a small way with high
values, that it is no exaggeration to say that
many properties are now paying their way. All
has been so swiftly done, and with so little fuss,
that it seems like a fairy tale, and the public have
no conception yet of the extraordinary value
of these alluvial tin propositions in Northern
Nigeria.</p>

<h3>POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL OUTLOOK</h3>

<p>It is satisfactory to gather from the report of
the acting Governor dated 11th December last,
that the year 1909 was a very peaceful one, the
military operations which it was found necessary
to carry out being on a small scale, and chiefly
on account of highway robberies. From all the
Provinces it is reported that the general feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
of the Emirs and native chiefs towards the British
Administration continues to be most friendly.
They are beginning to show an intelligent interest
and zeal in the political work, and political officers
are receiving support in any scheme proposed for
the improvement of the Native Administration.
The people show signs of wishing to be on
friendly terms with the Government, and the
agricultural classes are feeling a sense of security
which enables them to spread out in all directions
and take up new holdings. Their present position
is described as “one of progressive tranquillity
and content.” The inter-colonial traffic
in slaves has already ceased; local slave-dealing
is not entirely stamped out, but it is not extensive,
and last year 1,392 slaves were freed, practically
all by means of native courts, the majority of
these ex-slaves being self-redeemed.</p>

<p>The cultivation of food stuffs has increased;
new markets have been established, and the
present safety of the roads has greatly stimulated
the internal trade of the country. A great
improvement in the export trade has followed
the extension of the Baro-Kano Railway. To
the north of Minna there is a most extensive
area of shea butter trees, but very little of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
produce of this area has so far been placed on the
market, partly on account of the cost of transport,
and partly owing to the reluctance of the pagans
to have intercourse with markets outside their
districts. The construction of the railway has
done much towards gaining the confidence of
these people, and the reduction in the cost of
transport, consequent upon the completion of the
railway, will render it possible to place profitably
this sylvan produce on European markets.
Further north the railway will pass through the
rich agricultural and stock-raising Lausa provinces,
which at present export live-stock, skins,
and potass by means of annual caravans. The
idea that Northern Nigeria is an especially
unhealthy place for European residents is scarcely
borne out by the total death-rate of roughly twenty
per thousand, calculated on the average resident
European population; but the proportion of
officers invalided home is still large, though it is
much smaller than it was a few years ago, when
less satisfactory sanitary conditions prevailed at
the stations.</p>

<p>Although the addition of the Nigerian Protectorates
to the Empire is primarily due to the prescience
and enterprise of the Niger Company,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
that corporation has no monopoly of trade within
their boundaries nor any special advantage over
other traders. It takes its chances against rival
firms in the many spots in which it comes into
competition with them. At Gana Gana, for
instance, the company’s first station beyond
Burutu, the German firm of Bey &amp; Zimmer has
a depôt. John Holt &amp; Co., E. H. Stern &amp; Co.,
J. T. Palmer &amp; Co., Pagenstecher, and the British
Cotton Growing Association are all represented
in Nigeria, and the firm of G. W. Christian &amp; Co.
has established important trading stations at most
of the principal towns on the river. As recently
as 1904 Messrs. Christian started operations in
Nigeria at a small place named Proropro on the
left bank of the Niger; to-day they have branches
at Forcados, Burutu, Onitsha, Illah, Illushi, Idah,
and Lokoja, and at all these centres they not only
conduct a large cash and barter trade, but undertake
equipments and accept commissions, and
cater in every way for the requirements of both
Europeans and natives. The extraordinarily
rapid rise and progress of this firm is almost
entirely due to the exceptional qualifications for
the trade possessed by the principal, Mr. George
William Christian, who was born in Liverpool in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
1872, and who, from the early age of fifteen has
been associated with West Africa, and in twenty-five
years has acquired a thorough experience and
first-hand knowledge of the British and native
needs of the Protectorates.</p>

<p>To this company belongs the credit of being one
of the first to appreciate the almost unlimited
opportunities the tin fields of Northern Nigeria
offer for the employment of British capital. It
is not surprising, therefore, that it has to-day,
not merely one finger, but the whole of its digits
in the Nigerian “pie,” from which it has already
pulled out a “plum” in the shape of a dividend
of 100 per cent. paid in March last. It is not
always the pioneer in a new mining field who
strikes the richest areas, but under the guidance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
of its highly capable engineers, Champion Gold
Reefs of West Africa obtained exclusive rights
over some properties and interests in options over
others which promise a magnificent harvest in
years to come.</p>

<p>It was in September 1909, that the company decided
to abandon gold mining in Ashanti and devote
attention to tin mining in Northern Nigeria.
What were described as “very extensive alluvial
tin areas” were acquired on September 20. In a
circular to the shareholders, dated October 6, it was
stated that the work carried on by the Niger Company,
and the investigations of mining engineers in
the district had “proved the existence of very rich
alluvial ground, and already upwards of 1,000
tons of black tin, won by means of calabashes and
sluice boxes, had been shipped.” It was further
stated that on one of the properties, over which
the company had exclusive rights, there was a
waterfall of 480 feet, which would secure cheap
and ample power; that the properties were
situated some 3,500 feet above sea-level, and the
climate was good; that the district was thickly
populated, and the natives willing and anxious
to work.</p>

<p>The first members of the staff sailed for Northern
Nigeria on October 6, and were followed a month<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
later by Mr. Charles G. Lush, the well-known
expert on the working of alluvial tin deposits.
Mr. Lush was to advise as to the best method of
developing the company’s property, which was
then stated to be 13 square miles in extent.
Parenthetically it may be mentioned that other
suitable areas were afterwards taken up and
several handed over to subsidiary concerns. Mr.
Lush first went to the Juga and Sub-Juga properties,
and the first communication received from
him was the following cable, dated Bauchi,
December 17: “Have visited Juga, am very
favourably impressed. Up to the present time
proved alluvial extends over 200 acres and averages
9 feet; alluvial contains 4s. per cubic yard; the
value of stream tin, £600,000. I will visit Sub-Juga
this week.” On December 22 he again cabled
as follows: “Sub-Juga—Have visited, am very
favourably impressed. I consider admirably adapted
for the Australian method of working. It will be
necessary to erect a dam; will make survey and
report upon. Alluvial extends over 500 acres and
averages 9 feet. Estimated value of stream tin,
2s. 6d. per cubic yard.” From these and other communications
subsequently received it was evident
that Mr. Lush had been most favourably impressed
with the field generally, and with the value of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the Champion Gold Reefs property in particular.</p>

<p>Four subsidiary companies have been formed
to date, viz.:</p>

<ul>
<li>Naraguta (Nigeria) Tin Mines, Ltd.</li>
<li>Lucky Chance Mines, Ltd.</li>
<li>Juga (Nigeria) Tin and Power Company, Ltd.</li>
<li>Tin Fields of Northern Nigeria, Ltd.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Naraguta (Nigeria) Tin Mines is not only
a productive concern, but one that has already
entered the dividend list, 1s. per share having
been distributed. The property was originally
five square miles in extent, but the area has since
been extended. It was held under option by
Champion Gold Reefs, who transferred their option
to the present company. The purchase consideration
paid to the Niger Company was £50,000,
payable as to £30,000 in cash and £20,000 in
fully-paid shares. The Government and the Niger
Company are together entitled to a royalty of 10 per
cent. on the profits. Before the present company
was formed the Niger Company obtained from the
Naraguta property over 1,000 tons of tin concentrates,
and it is stated that in one square mile
of the property, which has been systematically
tested by pits, there are 10,000 tons of black tin
awaiting extraction. Up to the present time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
the ground treated has produced tin to the value
of £3,000 per acre, whereas in other countries,
such as Australia and the Malay Peninsula,
£1,000 per acre is considered phenomenal.
Some of the ground gives fully 5 lbs. of tin to the
cubic yard. There can be no doubt that Naraguta
is going to be one of the “gems” of the district.</p>

<p>The Lucky Chance Mines, Ltd., was originally
formed in May, 1905, to acquire property in New
Zealand, but at the end of 1908 only seven
shares had been issued, and the paid-up capital
was £5 5s., the company having no assets or
liabilities. Towards the end of last year, however,
it was placed on its financial legs by the
Champion Gold Reefs of West Africa. The latter
company sold certain of its tin areas to the Lucky
Chance Company for 200,000 shares, and agreed
to procure the subscription of 8,000 further shares.
To-day the Lucky Chance Company is a robust
and ably-controlled enterprise, with excellent
prospects of development. Its properties comprise
nearly 12,000 acres. The South Juga
property has recently been sold to the Juga
(Nigeria) Tin and Power Company for £10,000.</p>

<p>The Juga (Nigeria) Tin and Power Company
owns what is known as the Juga property, which
is situated on a plateau 3,280 feet above sea-level,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
having a total area of 1,600 acres, and the Sub-Juga
property, which lies upon the lower plateau
immediately below Juga, the area in this case
being 6,720 acres. As already remarked, the
South Juga property has recently been added.
Mr. Lush estimates that 200 acres of the Juga
property will be highly payable. For the purposes
of his estimate, he took the average depth as 9
feet, which, extending over 200 acres, equals
2,904,000 cubic yards, each cubic yard containing
6 lbs. “In valuing the ground at 6 lbs. per
cubic yard,” Mr. Lush said, “I am not taking
into account only the high results obtained from
some of the bottom wash, but am reckoning it as
a whole. I do this because working results may
prove that the wash does not extend over the
whole 200 acres, but the gravel does, and I feel
confident will average what I state.” In a similar
way he estimated that the Sub-Juga property
would yield 3 lbs. per cubic yard over 5,808,000
cubic yards.</p>

<p>Tin Fields of Northern Nigeria, Ltd., is a
company owning eight square miles at Federri
and nine square miles near Dila River, both in
the Bauchi Province.</p>

<p>In addition to having floated these companies—in
which, of course, Champion Gold Reefs retains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
a large interest—the company has also large
holdings in the following concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li>Northern Nigeria (Bauchi) Tin Mines.</li>
<li>Anglo-Continental Mines, Ltd.</li>
<li>Anchor Diamond Mines.</li>
</ul>

<p>It also still owns a lease over five square miles
in Ashanti.</p>

<p>This company owns an area of 3,200 acres
at Naraguta, and two further blocks known as
the “C” and “Q” areas of eight square miles.
It was formerly worked by the Niger Company,
who won from the alluvial beds its 1,000 tons of
tin concentrates. The company was registered
on 15th January, and the property was taken
over on 4th February. Mr. C. G. Lush, the
company’s consulting engineer, has inspected the
property, and has stated that on the Naraguta
property they had ground which would give fully
5 lbs. of tin to the cubic yard. He further<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
reported that ten acres had already been treated
and given that result, which could be taken as a
very fair prospecting whole.</p>

<p>The returns up to and including the month of
October 1910 amounted to a total of 350 tons of
tin oxide made up as follows:</p>

<p>Good profits can be, and are being, made
under the present primitive methods in use, but
the greatly increased profits to which the management
is looking forward can only be secured by
adopting the most up-to-date machinery, such as
is used in Tasmania and other countries. In
order to assure success experienced men are
being brought from Tasmania by the Champion
Gold Reefs group, and the Naraguta Company
will have the benefit of their advice.</p>

<p>At the statutory meeting in April last the
chairman stated: “We have the proud distinction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
of owning the property from which the first shipments
of tin were made—not only that, but one
of the richest out there, and I am quite confident
this company can look forward to a very successful
career. The extent of our property is four
square miles, one mile only of which has been
thoroughly prospected, and calculated to contain
10,000 tons of tin oxide. At the present market
price of tin this should yield over £500,000
profit. Our engineer tells me that up to the
present time every acre of ground so far treated
has produced tin to the value of £3,000, whereas
in other countries, such as Australia and Malay,
£1,000 per acre is considered phenomenal: therefore,
I consider we can congratulate ourselves upon
being interested in such a unique proposition.”</p>

<p>As an indication of what may be expected
when improved working methods have been
introduced, Mr. C. G. Lush states that thirty men
and one plant will be able to produce as much
and even more tin than is now being obtained
with three hundred men. “If we put only one
plant on the property,” he says, “it will take us,
perhaps, a hundred years to work it out, but
there is no reason why we should not have four
or five plants, and work it out in a lifetime!”
In Australia, Tasmania, and the Straits Settlements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
1½ lbs. of tin per cubic yard is considered
very good, but Mr. Lush is of opinion that in
Naraguta the ground will give fully 5 lbs. of tin
per cubic yard; in fact, 10 acres have already
been treated, and have given that result, which
can be taken as “a very fair prospecting whole.”
All that is necessary is to get the plant there as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>In Mr. Frank D. Bourke the company has an

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>(9) <i>Kwall Falls.</i>—The first application was
made on behalf of this company for this power,
which would be of great value, as it gives 2,000
horse-power in the dry season, and commands
several properties.</p>

<p>The <i>Dubbo</i> property is situated near the village
of Dubbo, on the Dubbo River, and west of the
Soli Hills. It is sometimes described as Topaz
Valley, so named on account of the large quantity
of topaz found in the wash. It is situated about
six miles north of Juga. The Lireui natives
have done a lot of work on this property, sinking
shafts in some cases a hundred yards back from
the Dubbo River. These shafts run from 8 to
10 feet in depth, proving that the bottom wash
must have been very rich for, as a rule, the
Lireuis only mined shallow ground where the
wash is easily got. Mr. Lush said that he had
not seen similar work in any other part of the tin
district.</p>

<p>Mr. Lush reported that the pannings from the
river bed gave very high values, and four shafts
sunk to a depth of 8 feet averaged 6 lbs. of tin to
the cubic yard. One shaft, which bottomed at
5 feet, went 30 lbs. of tin to the cubic yard. An
open-cut on the river bank exposed 17 feet of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
gravel, which went 6 lbs. to the cubic yard. The
overburden thrown out at the shafts sunk by the
Lireuis, where tried, gave an average of 5 lbs. of
tin to the cubic yard. At the southern end of
this property Mr. Lush says the river comes
down from a hill with a fall of some 350 feet
through a rocky gorge. By working a dam at
the top of the rapids sufficient water could be
conserved to run a plant by electrical transmission.
This country is mostly granite sand,
no stiff clay or pug. Mr. Lush states that nearly
the whole of the 632 acres are an alluvial deposit,
and in his estimates, in order to be well within
the mark, he estimates that the payable dirt
extends over 300 acres and averages 6 feet
in depth. The manager reported on August
29 that he had 300 men employed, and for the
four weeks ending August 27 he had recovered
31½ tons of tin, and had cut 735 feet of water
leads.</p>

<p><i>Rafinsiroma</i> adjoins Dubbo to the south, and the
manager, reporting on August 29, said he had just
started work on this property. On September 4
the manager reported that he had already shipped
505 lbs., and a cablegram received October 9
states that a further shipment is being made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>Work has been started on Polchi, and on
October 9 a cablegram was received stating that
the first shipment had been made.</p>

<p>On the <i>Bilidi River</i> property Mr. Lush reported
that he made several tests from wash exposed on
the river bank below the Kofai crossing, and
obtained payable tin results in all. He then
followed up the river for about three miles, and in
one part he says he got gold as well as tin in the
concentrates. In five pannings he reports there
were from six to ten colours of gold in every dish,
which in his opinion was highly satisfactory.
Two miles below the Kofai crossing he found
some very promising flats, where he also got eight
colours of gold in one dish. At the time of
his visit he says there was sufficient water running
in the Bauchi River for centrifugal pump
work.</p>

<p>As regards <i>Kurdum</i> and <i>Dila Rivers</i>, at the
lower end of the ground, near the village of
Bundas, Mr. Lush says he obtained very good
prospects of tin in gravel from the river bed. At
Dawka, some eight miles upstream, the wash
taken out of the river went 80 lbs. to the cubic
yard. Several pits were sunk on the banks, but
owing to soakage water only one bottomed, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
depth of which was 8 feet, and gave the following
result:</p>

<p>Overburden 7 feet went 3 lbs. of tin to the cubic
yard.</p>

<p>Bottom wash 1 foot went 60 lbs. of tin to the
cubic yard.</p>

<p>The river between Dawka and Bundas falls 400
feet, and at the latter town it is 30 feet by 2 feet
deep, flowing at the rate of 60 feet per minute.
Even in the middle of the dry season Mr. Lush
says a race cut from a point about a mile upstream
would give sufficient head to generate
500 h.p. by electricity.</p>

<p>Mr. L. H. L. Huddart, in his report on the
Kurdum River concession, says he feels justified
in making a preliminary estimate in order to give
an idea of what the property may be proved
to contain, and he bases it on the following
reasons:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The tin falls above the property.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The river has its source in a country rich
in tin.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The good values obtained in the stream bed
and samples taken from the banks.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The method of deposition of the alluvial
which indicates that “wash outs” are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
unlikely to be found. In fact some
good leads should have been left by the
river in the older gravels.</p>

</div>

<p>Upon these grounds he is of opinion that there
are about 300 acres of alluvial ground that
should prove to be about 2½ yards deep with
values of about 3 lbs. per cubic yard. Mr.
Huddart adds that an output of about 30 tons
per month, or 360 tons per year, should be
reached without difficulty. In conclusion, he says:
“The property is a good one, and its ample supply
of water cannot be too strongly emphasised. Tin
will be produced quickly from the river bed, and
systematic development should bear out the above
estimate, and enable the work to be laid out with
a view on ultimate production of about 40 tons
per month.”</p>

<p>Application for the Kwall Falls for electric
power has been made on behalf of this company,
and great importance is attached to them. They
are situated about 14 miles west of the Niger
(Bauchi) Syndicate’s area, and it is stated that in
the driest months there is ample water flowing
with a drop of 400 feet to generate 2,000 h.p.
without any expense of damming.</p>

<p><i>South Juga.</i>—Mr. C. G. Lush, in reporting on
the South Juga property, said: “On the northern
end there are several native workings, in which
payable prospects can be got. It would be advisable
to have shafts sunk right along the lead
from the Juga boundary to the Bauchi road, and
boring plant used if water hindered sinking to
bed-rock.... Some of the tin carried into Juga
must have found its way into South Juga.” Mr.
L. H. L. Huddart, reporting on the property,
said: “The elevation is about 3,000 feet above
the sea-level, with precipitous granite hills rising
at least 1,500 feet above the valley on both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
sides.... The tin occurs in a valley about four
miles long, running north-east and south-west.
Bed-rock is granite with frequent outcrops of
granite and granulite, which form baths more or
less at right angles to the valley. The average
width is about 2,000 feet.... The ground is
friable and easy to work.... A water course
which rises on Juga runs right down to the valley.
From December to April there is practically no running
water, but from May to November the stream
runs freely.... If the small tributaries are
dammed, and skill is used in saving the water,
there should be sufficient for all purposes for six
or seven months in the year. Later on a portable
pump elevating plant would have sufficient water
for at least nine months. There is a considerable
quantity of water held up between the granite
baths, and the water-locked ground provides
natural reservoirs.... A thorough system of
prospecting should be inaugurated.... Pits should
be put in right across the valley at 100 feet
intervals, and a property plan made out showing
the depth of ground valued. These will enable
the mining work to be laid out in a systematic
manner, and will disclose the rich leads.” Mr.
Huddart has formed a favourable opinion of the
property, and gives the following reasons for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
estimates he has prepared: (1) Amount of work
previously done by natives who never touch anything
but rich wash; (2) sampling and inspection
of native working and their tailings; (3) the fact
that this proposition is geographically a part of
Juga on which rich wash exists; (4) personal
knowledge of the ground tested and discoveries on
every known part of this field, and general occurrence
of cassiterite on all parts of the property.
Taking the property as a whole, he estimates
that there are 180 acres of alluvial ground, running
4 lbs. per cubic yard, averaging two yards
deep. In conclusion, Mr. Huddart says this is
an attractive property.... Importance is readily
attached to the fact that the property can be
made an immediate producer.</p>

<p><i>Juga Property.</i>—This property is on a plateau
3,280 feet above the sea-level, and Mr. Lush
estimates that 200 acres will be highly payable.
He takes the average depth of ground as 9 feet,
and this extending for 200 acres equals 2,904,000
cubic yards. The area is of exceedingly high
quality, and exceptionally free from impurities.
In his report Mr. Lush says: “Valuing the
ground at 6 lbs. per cubic yard, I am not taking
into account only the high results obtained from
some of the bottom wash, but am reckoning it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
as a whole. I do this because working results
may prove that the wash does not extend over
the whole 200 acres, but the gravel does, and I
feel confident will average what I state.”</p>

<p><i>Sub-Juga.</i>—This property, comprising an area
of 6,720 acres, lies upon the lower plateau, or
plain, immediately below Juga. The natives
have done a great deal of work here, and their
beds were extensively tried by Mr. Lush, who
got very rich prospects when panning. Some of
the dish concentrates went as high as 40 lbs. of
tin oxide to the cubic yard, and in no single
instance did he get less than 3 lbs. He considers
that out of the 6,720 acres 400 are proved to
be highly payable, but this only includes the
main lead, which runs right through the property
for 6¼ miles, and does not include any of the
runs coming in from east and west. He takes the
average depth of ground as 9 feet; this extending
for 400 acres equals 5,808,000 cubic yards.
Mr. Lush has recommended movable plants for
these properties. Transmission of electrical
power to run both the nozzle and the gravel
pumps is, of course, the cheapest and best method
of working, but it will be some time, probably
two years, before the contemplated hydraulical
scheme can be installed. Mr. Lush’s recommendations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
have been accepted by the board,
and two plants are being constructed, and their
cost when mounted and erected at the mine will
not exceed £10,000. In addition to the sluice
boxes at present on the property, there are now
on the way a further sixty-nine sluice boxes, with
all exhausters complete, and these will enable
sluicing and calabashing to be carried on pending
the arrival and erection of the hydraulic plant.</p>

<p>Mr. Hooke has been appointed manager, with
Mr. Grant as his assistant. Besides sluicing,
surveys have to be completed, dams constructed,
prospecting done, especially by means of boring,
tools being supplied for those parts where the
water is too heavy for the pits to be sunk.</p>

<p>Mr. A. W. Hooke writes under date September
14, 1910, as follows:</p>

<p>“Attached hereto are my notes upon the leases
of the company and the dam site. In setting
forth this general report several difficulties have
faced the writer—the absence of any systematic
sampling record—the flooded condition of the
existing holes, and the short time in which to
cover the ground.</p>

<p>“At the same time also an effort had to be made
to organise the labour and increase the output
under existing circumstances. I give the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>

in the last four weeks. From August 15

<p>“Some of this ore is being won on Juga, but
by far the greater part comes from Nafuta. It
contains much iron impurity, and a streaming box
has already been made for its re-treatment at
Juga. It will be understood that the natives
bring their weekly winnings from Nafuta to Juga
on Sundays, when it is weighed and purchased
from them. The first three lots shown above
were purchased approximately at ¾d. per lb.,
and the last one at ½d. The condition of the
tin, &amp;c., is a big factor in guiding one as to the
price, but as time goes on I hope to instruct the
native into the way of streaming his tin and
bringing it to a better quality. If I can do this,
and keep the price down, it means a big advantage
to us.</p>

<p>“Labour at 6d. per day is most satisfactory
(9d. is the ruling rate elsewhere except at Dubbo).
This week my whole gang struck work and demanded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
an increase from 6d. to 9d. I flatly
refused, and to time of writing have almost as
many new men as I require. Some of the old
hands have since returned to work. I have despatched
a headman to Gingim and Polchi, who
will doubtless secure all that I require.</p>

<p>“At Nafuta sampling shafts are being sunk at
the rate of about nine per week. These cannot be
quite bottomed on account of the water in the
wash, but as the rain eases off they can be completed
and sampled.</p>

<p>“<i>General.</i>—The three leases are all properties
upon which hydraulic sluicing can be carried out
satisfactorily, and the wash and overburden in
each case is ideal material for gravel pumping.
I am quite pleased with the general condition of
things, but am anxious to have my sampling completed,
so that I may form some estimate of
yardage and the average value.”</p>

<h4>PRELIMINARY REPORT BY MR. ARTHUR W. HOOKE, ACCOMPANYING HIS LETTER
OF SEPTEMBER 14, 1910.</h4>

<p><i>Juga Property.</i>—This lease stands at the
highest elevation of the three, and practically
forms the divide between South Juga and Nafuta.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
Its watershed is large, and the greater portion of
this goes north-east through the Nafuta gorge
to the flats. The lease embraces an area of
1,440 acres and compasses the flats adjacent to
two streams coming from the South, which unite
and continue north-east, passing into the Nafuta
gorge as the Juga River.</p>

<p>The maximum depth of the ground is only
about 12 feet, and much of it is amenable to
ground sluicing, though it could be handled more
advantageously by gravel pumps. This latter
scheme is eventually the policy to adopt, as
thereby most of the material can be stacked after
treatment, and any chance of silting-up be avoided.</p>

<p>The former (ground sluicing) will be a temporary
expedient—I say temporary advisedly, because
the detritus from such operations will
eventually find its way to the area for the dam
site above the Nafuta gorge. It will be readily
understood that the shape of the property is irregular
in order to most economically take in the
desired area.</p>

<p>The rocky surroundings naturally bring down
their storm waters rapidly, and this will always
act as a deterrent in ground sluicing and be a
point in favour of power plants.</p>

<p>The lease carries a sparse supply of timber,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
but will justify the installation of a steam plant
of such dimensions as that already under construction.
As time wears on, however, an alternative
power must have consideration.</p>

<p>The contour of the country does not lend itself
to the construction of earthwork headraces, &amp;c.,
being too rocky; service water, will therefore
have to be carried in a pipe service.</p>

<p>I am forwarding a sketch plan showing the
two streams and their confluence under the name
of the Juga. Pits as shown have been sunk
and a sampling done. The samples (Mr. Robinson
informs me) were taken by a native headman,
and run very erratically from 17 lbs. to nil per
cubic yard. Robinson says that some of the
holes at that time had been flooded, and is of
opinion that all the bottom wash in some instances
was not included in the samples taken.</p>

<p>At the present time all the pits are more or
less flooded and silted, but I will re-sample the
whole of these and advise results at the earliest
possible moment.</p>

<p>The two dams shown in the sketch have been
carried away by floods. Higher up the river at
“A,” a much better site exists, which will give
more pressure and command more ground. I
propose to place one here as soon as I can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>The tracts shown on the drawing will give
some idea of the direction in which the other
leases lie.</p>

<p>Viewed in conjunction with the plans, the
directors will have a more concise idea of
their relative positions.</p>

<p><i>Nafuta or Sub-Juga.</i>—Of the exclusive area
held here some 1,850 acres have been embodied
in the mining lease just issued. It embraces
what appears to be the pick of the Nafuta flats
and encloses a maximum of alluvial drift with
a minimum of rock, and at the same time adheres
to the water-course. The Nafuta gorge terminates
quite abruptly, and opens in an expansive
plain lying some 400 feet below. The lease
commences at the foot of the gorge, and runs
along the river in a north-easterly direction.
Its width embraces the deepest of the flats,
though there is still some ground at the south-west
corner of the exclusive area that warrants
attention. I should say from a cursory examination
that the amount of workable ground is
in excess of that of the other leases, though no
attempt can be made to quote tonnage until
many more pits have been sunk. It is from this
area that most of our present tin is being won.
The tin contains much impurity, such as iron,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
and the natives find a difficulty in separating it
by calabashing.</p>

<p>The average depth, judging by the present trial
pits, is 12 feet. The wash is clear and medium
sized, and the overburden is ideal material for
removal where viewed in the old paddocks.</p>

<p>I see no difficulties in it as a gravel sluicing
proposition, once provision is made for power.
The lease carries no timber, and is a power consideration
from the beginning.</p>

<p>Of tin value I can quote last week’s winning of
4,000 odd lbs. of crude tin by 120 men with
calabashes, and this too in the face of many
weather difficulties.</p>

<p>A site has been set aside for a native village,
and already people are congregating and erecting
their grass huts.</p>

<p><i>South Juga.</i>—This lease, as its name implies,
lies south of Juga. It covers 855 acres, and is
approximately 4 miles long by 2,000 yards wide.
It is traversed for its entire length by the track
which leaves the Toro-Bauchi road and comes on
to Juga. The lease is narrow—it lies in a long
gully, and appears bound by a succession of rocky
bars. These no doubt may be acting as excellent
natural tin savers, but they will make work very
irregular. Of the tin value here I cannot speak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
with any definiteness. I have not traversed the
ground in detail, and as no pits have been sunk
upon it, I have no samples to guide me. It will
have my attention so soon as I can get one lease
into a regular producing stage.</p>

<p><i>Nafuta Dam Site.</i>—In proceeding from Juga to
Nafuta one traverses the basin of this proposed
dam. As a site its position would be hard to
beat. It covers some 356 acres, which narrows
down to a steep rocky neck, through which the
waters debouch on to the Nafuta flat. The sides
of the gorge rise in an abrupt slope, and are composed
of granite. It forms an ideal situation for
a retaining wall which, if reared 100 feet, would
throw back 326 million cubic feet of water. This
quantity of water would develop approximately
550 horse-power for 370 days of 12 hours,
using 1,220,000 cubic feet per day, and allowing
525,000 cubic feet for daily evaporation and
soakage losses.</p>

<p>At present the dam area is enclosed in the
Nafuta <i>exclusive area</i>, which expires at Christmas.
I propose therefore to take it up as an agricultural
lease, which I believe can be secured at annual
rental of 1s. per acre.</p>

<p>The dam is a necessity for the operation of
Nafuta, though, of course once established, it could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
generate high tension electricity for transmission
to Juga and South Juga, and operate them as well.</p>

<p>A masonry retaining wall could, I think, be
most cheaply built, as the stone exists on the
site. It would be the installation of a quarrying
plant of say half-dozen rock drills and channelling
machines, also a small aerial line up the bed of
the dam for handling the stone, and a “flying
fox” gear across the gorge for handling all the
stone in the retaining wall.</p>

<p>In some places at the lower end the water is
lost to sight 30 feet or more beneath the huge
granite boulders that lie in the gorge.</p>

<p>This syndicate owns the following properties
in the Bauchi Province:—</p>

<p><i>Rein.</i>—An exclusive licence to prospect an area
of 4½ square miles near the towns of Rein and
Forum.</p>

<p><i>South Bukeru.</i>—An exclusive licence to prospect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
an area of 3 square miles south of Bukeru,
and sold to the company of that name.</p>

<p><i>Shen.</i>—A mining licence to work an area of
24 acres on the left bank of the Shen stream.</p>

<p>The Rein property is situated on the south-eastern
side of the Bauchi Tin Fields, between
the pagan towns of Forum and Rein. The area
encloses about six miles of a stream flowing in
the northerly direction from Rein to Forum, where
it junctions with a system of rivers on which the
Ribon, Bisichi, Doss, and other properties are
situated.</p>

<p>The area is three-quarters of a mile wide by
six miles long, an extent of 4½ square miles,
practically the whole of which is tin-bearing
alluvial. The alluvial is composed of a sandy
material of an extremely free nature, and the
bottom is the usual coarse grey granite. The
latter outcrops in very few places, and carries
from about a yard to four yards of alluvial
ground. Although the bottom could be reached
in only a few places in the stream bed, good
prospects of black tin were obtained in nearly all
samples panned, and from the alluvial flats, as
exposed by the banks of the stream, the results
ran from about 3 to 5 lbs. of tin per cubic
yard. The panning concentrates contained 10<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
to 15 per cent. of titaniferous iron sand (which
was allowed for), but this mineral presents no
difficulties, and can be easily eliminated by the
ordinary dressing operations.</p>

<p>The width of the property (three-quarters of a
mile) does not include the whole of the large
alluvial flats that occur on either side of the
river, but having secured the river and so much
of the adjacent ground, these flats are protected,
and, if necessary, may be taken up when the land
for mining purposes is selected.</p>

<p>Of the area staked, certainly more than two-thirds
carries alluvial ground of the thickness
given above. Except in the bed of the stream,
rich patches are not expected, but a fairly uniform
value throughout.</p>

<p><i>Water.</i>—There is a continuous flow of water
for sluicing purposes all the year round.</p>

<p><i>Grades.</i>—Cannot be determined without survey,
but at the lower (Forum) end of the property
there is sufficient fall to allow the tailings to be
inexpensively dealt with.</p>

<p><i>Costs.</i>—Will compare favourably with other
mines in the district, <i>i.e.</i> with ground of moderate
value the costs would amount to between £10
and £15 per ton of black tin, and present
transport charges £27 10s. per ton inclusive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>Final tests of the flats are capable of being
cheaply and quickly carried out by means of trial
pits; boring is unnecessary. The probability is
that the workable ground will prove to be of too
large an area to be included in one mining lease,
and that it will be necessary to split the present
area into two or more properties.</p>

<p><i>Shen Property.</i>—This property is situated on
the left bank of the Shen stream, on which it has
been pegged out for some distance with an average
width of about two chains. The Shen property
adjoins the concession acquired by the Bisichi
Tin Company (Nigeria), Ltd.</p>

<p><i>South Bukeru.</i>—This property, comprising an
area of three square miles, is situated about four
miles south of Bukeru. It is situated on the
top of the Bukeru watershed, a basin heavily
watered with small streams running through
the whole area, which is stated to be alluvial,
and all the ground is tin-bearing from the top to
the bottom of the pits, which have been sunk
to a depth of about fifteen feet. Pump or
boring plant will be necessary to thoroughly
test the property. This property has been
sold to the South Bukeru (Nigeria) Tin Co.,
Ltd.</p>

<p>This company owns four areas aggregating
14 square miles in Nigeria, and in addition to
these has large holdings of shares in the leading
companies operating in this field, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Champion Gold Reefs of West Africa, Ltd.</li>
<li>Naraguta (Nigeria) Tin Mines, Ltd.</li>
<li>Juga Tin and Power Company, Ltd.</li>
<li>Anglo-Continental Mines, Ltd.</li>
<li>Northern Nigeria (Bauchi) Tin Mines, Ltd.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another of the company’s assets to which considerable
importance is attached is the interest in
the Juga (Nigeria) Tin and Power Company, whose
property comprises what is known as the Juga
area, situated on a plateau 3,280 feet above sea-level,
amounting to 1,600 acres, and the Sub-Juga
area which, as its name implies, is situated
upon the lower plateau immediately below Juga,
amounting to 6,720 acres. A further property,
known as the South Juga, has also been acquired.
From August 15 to September 10 the quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
crude tin produced by the Juga Company was
12,339 lbs., but Mr. C. G. Lush, the consulting
engineer, states that, as in the case of the
Naraguta property, the bed of the river, in
which the richest deposits of tin are contained,
is exposed for calabashing in the dry season,
which is now beginning, so that a much larger
output of tin may be confidently expected in
the near future. New plant is now being supplied
capable of dressing twelve tons of tin oxide
per day.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Continental Mines Company is largely
interested in what are undoubtedly the best gold
mines in the Tarkwa and Prestea, districts of
West Africa, but it has also a substantial
slice of the Nigerian “cake.” It has already
had one profitable “deal” in the successful flotation
of the Northern Nigeria (Bauchi) Tin Mines,
Ltd.—a company holding prospecting licences
over a compact block of 50 square miles in
the Bauchi Province, and mining licences over
three blocks of about 12½ acres each. Portions
of the property have been worked sufficiently
by the Niger Company to prove their exceptional
value as tin-bearing areas. Mr. C. G. Lush,
reporting in February last, stated: “From surface
pannings I should estimate the over-burden,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
or rather stanniferous gravelly deposit overlying
the wash, to go 2 lbs. per cubic yard....
Provided sufficient power is obtained, there is
room here for at least four big plants capable
of treating 10,000 cubic yards of gravel each
per week. 40,000 yards at 2 lbs. equals
80,000 lbs. of tin oxide, equal to 35 tons per
week, which, at £80, means £2,800; less cost
of treatment at 6d. per yard £1,000, carriage
on 35 tons of tin (at £15) £525, Government
royalty at 10 per cent. £127, leaving a net
weekly profit of £1,148.” The Anglo-Continental
Mines Company has a large interest in this company,
and is looking for big dividends therefrom
in the not very distant future. But this is not
by any means the full extent of its interest in
Northern Nigeria, for it has acquired an adjoining
area of 50 square miles, which are stated to
afford equally satisfactory prospects.</p>

<p>Apart from the indirect interest the Nigerian
Tin Corporation has in the Northern Nigeria
(Bauchi) Tin Mines, through the Anglo-Continental
Mines Company already referred to, it has
a large holding on its own account.</p>

<p>The original intention, when the Nigerian Tin
Corporation was formed, was that it should confine
itself entirely to taking participation in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
deals and promotions, but feeling persuaded that
this is the most important virgin tin field the
world has yet seen, the directors decided to
extend the scope of the corporation’s operations,
and, as already stated, four areas have been
acquired of eight, three, two, and one square
miles respectively.</p>

<p>Mr. H. O. Crighton, late manager of the Pusing
Lama Mine, in the Straits Settlements, has been
appointed the company’s manager in Northern
Nigeria in January last, and has already taken up
three areas on behalf of this company.</p>

<p>This company has exclusive prospecting rights
over an area of 50 square miles in the Naraguta
district of Northern Nigeria, together with mining
licences over a further area of 12½ acres
situated at the head-waters of a small river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>The manager of this company in Nigeria is
Mr. Means, who has done a considerable amount
of prospecting on the property. This large
property of 50 square miles was originally secured
by the Anglo-Continental Company. It is believed
there are several large areas of alluvial tin
on the property, which has not yet been properly
prospected.</p>

<p>With regard to the smaller concession of 12½
acres, Mr. Lush confirmed the statement that the
alluvial tin at this point was exceptionally rich,
averaging as much as 12 lbs. per cubic yard.</p>

<p>In his report on this property dated February
21, 1910, Mr. Lush said:</p>

<p>“From surface pannings I should estimate the
overburden, or rather stanniferous gravelly deposit
overlying the wash, to go 2 lbs. per cubic yard.
It would be interesting to see the values and
thickness of the bottom wash. Provided sufficient
power is obtained, there is room here for at
least four big plants capable of treating 10,000
cubic yards of gravel each per week: 40,000
yards at 2 lbs. equals 80,000 lbs. of tin oxide,
equal to 35 tons per week.</p>

<p>“I look for a fair depth of payable ground,
everything points to its being so, but only boring
can decide this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“Life of property would largely depend on the
depth of the deposit and the number of plants
erected, but presuming the deposit is 15 feet deep,
and you instal four plants capable of putting
through 10,000 yards weekly each, it would take
fully eight years to work out this 500 acres of
the property.</p>

<p>“I understand that the total area of land taken
over by you from the Niger Bauchi Syndicate
is 50 square miles, or 32,000 acres. In this
report I am only dealing with the southern and
south-western part of your holding, some 20
square miles, as I did not visit the northern portion.
I was, however, credibly informed by one
of the Government mining officials that on the
northern block of 30 square miles there are also
stanniferous deposits, and in addition a very
promising tin lode, a continuation of the one that
has been opened up by the Niger Company on
your eastern boundary. The actual value and
life of only the area I have reported upon would,
in my opinion, quite justify your proceeding with
vigorous development work at once. The probable
values of the remaining 30 square miles
may possibly turn out equal to the southern;
there is no reason why they should not, as the
whole of the property is within a rich alluvial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
and lode tin district that has hardly as yet been
scratched.”</p>

<p>On June 15 the company’s representative in
Nigeria cabled: “Active sluicing operations will
be commenced as soon as sufficient water is
available. Meantime 6 tons of tin have been
produced by means of calabashes.”</p>

<p>A complete sluicing plant has been shipped,
and pending its arrival washing by means of
calabashes is being continued.</p>

<p>At the first statutory meeting, Mr. Lush said,
since delivering his report:</p>

<p>“I see by a cablegram from Mr. Means that
he has found good tin on other areas. There
are about 4 square miles of about 2,600 acres that
have been proved to carry tin since I left there.”</p>

<h4>REPORT ON THE N’GELL RIVER TIN DEPOSITS, NORTHERN NIGERIA</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Mr. H. W. Laws</span></p>

<p>The N’Gell River, which is one of the sources
of the Kaduna, rises in the pagan town of N’Gell
on the highest watershed of the country.</p>

<p>Black oxide of tin is found in large quantities
in the bed of this river where it is not deeply
covered with gravel, and in the various streams<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
flowing into it, especially those coming in from the
south. The ore undoubtedly has a very local
origin, it is derived largely from the denudation
of the small tin-bearing quartz veins in pegmatite
granite on the sources of the tributaries known as
Nos. 1 and 2 streams, and lode matter containing
massive crystals of tin is also breaking down in
the neighbourhood of Nos. 4 and 5 streams.
All these it will be noted are on the south side
of the river.</p>

<p>For the purpose of discussing these tin deposits
as a mining proposition, the river may be
conveniently divided into three portions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><span class="allsmcap">A.</span> The headwaters of the N’Gell River (sections
49 and 50 on plan) with Nos. 1, 2, and 3
streams.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="allsmcap">B.</span> The portion of the N’Gell River flowing
through the Niger Company’s area for a
distance of 2½ miles with the tributaries
known as Nos. 4, 5, and 6 streams, and</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="allsmcap">C.</span> The portion of the N’Gell River flowing for
a distance of six miles through section 46
and 36 to 40 on the plan.</p>

</div>

<h5>A</h5>

<p>This portion is actually on the apex of the
watershed. The streams which fall rapidly to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
the valley below on the west are crossed by
numerous bars of granite and quartz reefs, which
act as natural riffles, and have served to concentrate
the ore in high values, but relatively small
quantities of alluvial in the beds and banks of the
streams. Good alluvial also occurs in patches
amongst the granite hills away from the waterways.</p>

<p>The streams get a fairly regular supply of
water from springs and the drainage of the
many veins, but they are also subject to scouring
floods caused by heavy but entirely local
rains. The floods are breaking down the alluvial
with great rapidity, and large quantities of ore
must be washed down to the valley below every
year.</p>

<p>During three months of somewhat irregular
work last year we recovered 30 tons of black
tin from Nos. 1 and 2 streams. Part of this
was won by sluicing the alluvial banks, of which
2,736 cubic yards, worth 10 to 11 lbs. of black
tin per yard, were worked. Operations were
commenced from the boundary, the ground was
worked fairly, and although superficially it only
represents some 300 square yards, it gives a fair
idea of the value of the bank deposits. The
values, of course, would not apply to the alluvial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
apart from the streams, nor to that on No. 3
stream, where there is far less grade and more
alluvial, but, taken as a whole, the proposition is
decidedly the richest yet found in Nigeria. Until
further prospecting has been done and a detailed
survey carried out, it is impossible to give any
accurate estimate of the payable alluvial available
on this portion; as a hand-work proposition it is
not of great extent (as will be gathered from my
report to the Niger Company last December,
a copy of which I attach), but as an area
systematically worked with the aid of machinery,
it is undoubtedly a property which should produce
a large tonnage of tin over a period of many
years.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned report also clearly sets
forth the difficulties in the way of systematic mining,
if it is to be regarded as a separate concern.
I have carefully considered the methods suggested
by Mr. Lush in his report. The first we have
already tried. The second is impracticable, because
we have no higher level at which we could
conserve water for hydraulicing the whole of
the alluvial deposits, and the third and fourth
can only be considered in conjunction with one
or both of the other portions of the N’Gell
River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>A modification of the second suggestion might
prove satisfactory as a temporary measure. It
would be possible to conserve in a reservoir constructed
near the head of one of the streams
sufficient water to sluice by gravity—I do not
think there would be pressure for hydraulicing—the
alluvial in and near the main river and
part of that about the three streams. The ground
higher up the streams could not be worked by
this means.</p>

<h5>B</h5>

<p>This portion of the river flows through the
Niger Company’s area, as shown on the plan
attached. The river, after leaving the town of
N’Gell, falls into a fine open valley within which
is an apparently deep basin filled in with loose
gravels heavily charged with water.</p>

<p>Four important streams numbered 3, 4, 5,
and 6, enter the river from the south, three of
them having falls in the position marked on
the plan.</p>

<p>In addition to the alluvial being washed down
the main stream, this basin must also be enriched
by the tin-bearing wash in the tributaries, which
also show good prospects.</p>

<p>The basin covers an area of roughly 300 acres,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
not including the bank deposits on the streams
or the higher level flats. As would be expected
from the nature of the ground, the top gravels
do not carry payable values, but it seems to me
almost impossible for the bottom to be other
than rich when it is remembered that tin will
not travel far without easy outlet and good grades,
and that for a long period tin-bearing dirt has
been emptying itself into this basin from so many
channels. We have been unable to reach bottom
in ordinary trial pits owing to heavy water and
the running nature of the alluvial, and it will now
have to be tested by boring.</p>

<p>Even if it proves only a low-grade show, it
is obviously a big mine, and one that must be
worked by dredging or pumping methods. Possibly
the three falls above mentioned would give
sufficient power, in which case the problem of
working the “A” deposits would be solved at the
same time. Otherwise it would be necessary to
acquire the Kwall Falls, and generate electric
power there.</p>

<h5>C</h5>

<p>I am not so familiar with this portion of the
river, but, generally speaking, it is of a similar
character to “B,” and the same remarks apply,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
but with this important exception, that it is down
stream and therefore farther away from the source
of the tin. I am not in a position to say whether
it is fed by other tin-bearing streams or rocks
further to the west.</p>

<p>As your Chairman very reasonably suggested,
there may be an obstruction in the shape of
rising bedrock or bars about Section 46, in which
case this portion may prove of little value. This
can only be disclosed by continuing the boring
operations, and I would here emphasise Mr.
Lush’s opinion that the greatest care should be
exercised in taking samples from holes in these
loose gravels where boring has a tendency to
concentrate the heavier mineral at the bottom.</p>

<h5>RECOMMENDATIONS</h5>

<p>As some difficulty is anticipated in holding the
areas as they now stand after this year, I suggest
that they be dealt with as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">(<span class="allsmcap">A</span>) The streams and alluvial deposits on this
portion are spread over some six square
miles of country, so that my previous
suggestion that the whole should be
taken up in one rectangular mining area
is not feasible. A mining area should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
be acquired over Sections 49 and 50 as
under:—</p>

<p class="indented">Commencing at the N’Gell Beacon,
thence 2 miles due west, thence 1 mile
due north, thence 2 miles due east, and
thence 1 mile due south to the starting
point, enclosing an area of 2 square
miles.</p>

<p class="indented">Mining licences over Nos. 1, 2, and 3
streams should be renewed.</p>

</div>

<p>The above four mining areas will not include
all the alluvial mentioned in this report as existing
on this portion (<span class="allsmcap">A</span>), but if the three streams are
held, the alluvial lying between them will be
safe from others, who would have no water for
working it. This is only intended to meet the
case temporarily, and until further surveys have
been made and the Mining Laws revised.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">(<span class="allsmcap">B</span>) Negotiations should be entered into with
the Niger Company to take over this
part of the river, or with a view to an
amalgamation of interests.</p>

<p class="indented">A mining licence should then be
obtained to commence at a beacon
10,343 feet due west of the N’Gell
beacon, thence 2½ miles due west,
thence 1 mile due south, thence 2½<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
miles due east, thence 1 mile due north
to the starting point, enclosing an area
of 2½ square miles.</p>

<p class="hanging">(<span class="allsmcap">C</span>) I recommend that an exclusive prospecting
licence be applied for, identical with
Sections 36 to 40, enclosing an area
of five square miles. If a prospecting
licence is not allowed in any form, the
expense of holding this piece of land
under mining licences must be borne
until prospecting is completed.</p>

<p class="indented">There remains only the river flowing
through Sections 46 and 35. A rectangular
prospecting area (or, if refused,
a mining area) ½ mile wide, east and
west, by about 1¼ miles long, north and
south, will be sufficient to hold this while
its examination is going on.</p>

</div>

<p>With regard to staff and the work for the
immediate future, a good surveyor and assistant
must be sent out whose chief duty, apart from the
demarcation of boundaries, would be the determination
of grades in the rivers, measurement of
water, survey of falls, and the preparation of
sections showing the alluvial beds as disclosed by
the pits and bores. An experienced man to carry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
out the boring operations should also be provided,
and the whole work placed in charge of a capable
hydraulic mining engineer.</p>

<h5>CONCLUSION</h5>

<p>It is above all things desirable to aim at working
the whole of the deposits about this river as
one large power proposition, deriving the power
either from falls on the property or from Kwall.
Should it be found impossible to do this (from
failure to secure the land and falls required), then
it will have to be proved whether the deposits on
the six square miles of “A” portion justify the
expense of harnessing falls and conveying power
to the heads of the streams. If not, as much of
the alluvial as possible must be worked out by the
same system of sluicing as was employed last
year, but on an increased scale, and with a more
elaborate method of dealing with the water
supply.</p>

<p>I am of opinion that it will take a year with a
competent staff to prove the six miles of land
referred to in “A” portion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—I beg to hand you herewith Summary
of tin returns for the months of November
and December.</p>

<p><i>Tin Recovery.</i>—Work ceased on the 14th
instant owing to Mr. Carpenter’s time being
completed, and his desire to return to England;
otherwise sluicing on No. 1 stream could have
continued to the end of the year. Sluicing on
No. 2 stream was stopped early in November
owing to want of water.</p>

<p>The black tin recovered for November amounted
to 12 tons and 2 lbs., and from December 1st to
14th, 4 tons 14 cwts. 3 qrs. 12 lbs., making a total
of 30 tons 0 cwts. 1 qr. 3 lbs. for the three
months that mining operations have been carried
on, as shown on the summary.</p>

<p>The ground sluiced at No. 1 stream measures
approximately 2,736 cubic yards, worth 10 to
11 lbs. of black tin per cubic yard.</p>

<p>In arriving at these figures, the tin taken from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
the actual river bed, where it was impossible to
measure the ground sluiced, is excluded, and this
value will be found to be a fair average for the
alluvial bank deposits on the N’Gell areas.</p>

<p>I estimate there is sufficient of this to last for
six years on the two areas we have taken up,
but this does not include some fairly extensive
deposits between the three N’Gell streams and
outside our small mining leases, which we have
recently found to exist. We have not attempted
to develop these higher deposits, but wherever
tried they carry good values, and if by careful
selection we added them to the existing areas, the
proposition would become an important one as far
as quantity is concerned. The difficulty lies
in economical working. The present method,
although profitable, is unsatisfactory, at any rate
from an engineering point of view; my experience
of the last three months has proved that sluicing
in a small way can only proceed between seasons—in
the dry season only hand-work can be done,
and at the height of the rains the sluices cannot
be fixed low enough to receive the sluicing water.
It is essentially an elevating proposition, but
without power, fuel, or water, we are helpless.
I therefore recommend you, should an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
occur, to give careful consideration to any amalgamation
scheme which our neighbours on the
N’Gell River might think desirable after they
become familiar with their property, especially if
they decide to work on a large scale.</p>

<p>Should no opportunity of the kind occur, I
advise you to take the best out of the three
streams and their alluvial banks by our present
cheap sluicing methods and handwork during the
next six years or so. A good engineer and an
assistant would be required to supervise, but the
former would only be required at certain seasons
and not permanently on the property. I am
preparing a list of plant required to work economically
on these lines on the three streams.</p>

<p><i>Export.</i>—The tin won was all first grade,
assaying 72 per cent. to 73 per cent. 644 bags,
weighing net 19 tons 9 cwts. 3 qrs. 7 lbs., were
despatched in November, and 350 bags, weighing

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>Since the preparation of the foregoing particulars
a report has been received from the company’s
manager giving the first detailed particulars of the
prospecting as follows:—</p>

<p>“<i>Prospecting.</i>—With regard to this important
subject I expect to have a little more to say when
I have a general map ready to forward to you.
The shaft in Section 26 which you asked about
in your letter of 26th July was not got down to
bedrock on account of water, and there were no
results to report. In prospecting the streams of
the central and northern part of the 40-mile area,
we found tin in many places in various quantities,
and irregularly distributed. Apparently the best
stream is that one which runs through Section 28;
while prospecting there we calabashed out five tons
very easily from the bed of the stream, which
tin we have in stock and shall report it to the
Government as soon as the mining lease is applied
for. The prospecting by numerous pits shows that
the ground is too irregular in values outside the
bed of the stream to make satisfactory estimates
until some sluicing is done, which will be a relatively
easy matter when we have the mining
lease. There is another stream about three miles
further north which I think will warrant taking up,
but perhaps not quite so good as that in Section 28.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>“In prospecting other streams of the northern
part of the 40-mile area we generally found from
a trace of tin to say a pound or so per yard with
limited yardage, and none of them offer much
encouragement to the company for mining
purposes.</p>

<p>“A part of the N’Gell River, in Sections 49 to
50, I think is suitable for taking up as a mining
lease. The tin, however, appears to be mostly
confined to the river bed, and therefore it is more
suitable for calabashing than for sluicing purposes.
Also the parts of streams Nos. 1 and 2, which are
in the prospecting area, should be included in the
areas applied for.”</p>

<p>The manager further states, in regard to the
drilling operations which are being carried out on
the more remote and westerly portion of the
property, that the results hitherto obtained have
not been very encouraging, but that it is too early
to arrive at a definite conclusion in regard to
final results.</p>

<p>Cable advice has been received of the recovery
of ten tons of tin during the month of October.
The manager adds that the water is falling
rapidly; this should permit of calabashing on an
extended scale. The value of the tin already won
by intermittent working should realise nearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
£4,000, a sum in excess of the outlay in respect
of the surveying and prospecting on which the
small staff has been principally occupied.</p>

<p>The company acquired from the Tin Areas of

were originally held by the Niger Company. Mr.
Charles Scott has been engaged as mine manager,
and is now on the property, from which about
20 tons of black tin were won during May, June,
and July.</p>

<p>At the statutory meeting held on 22nd August,
the chairman said:</p>

<p>“I may say that I have had the pleasure on
two or three occasions of meeting Mr. H. W.
Laws, who was the chief mining engineer of the
Niger Company in Northern Nigeria, and is now
their consulting engineer here. He had for some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
time the direction of the work on this particular
mine. In the course of friendly conversations
with him, he told me that he was of opinion that
our company should get back its capital, together
with interest commensurate with the risk run in
all mining enterprises. He also told me that he
considered the mine could go on producing indefinitely
anything up to 200 tons of tin per
annum, without any capital expenditure, but he
added that he thought that would be a very
wrong policy to pursue, and that the right thing
to do was to have, as we intend having, a
thorough survey made of the property, and then
come to a conclusion as to the best method of
working it. I think that it is very satisfactory to
hear this from Mr. Laws, because it points to the
fact that we have really got a sound property, and
one which, if properly managed, will prove to be
a sound speculative investment. It is a property
which must be regarded as a low-grade proposition.
Although, of course, it is more fascinating to have
a property which may be called a very rich
one, yet a large low-grade property is really far
more satisfactory from the shareholders’ point of
view than a property which is simply rich in
patches, because with a large low-grade proposition
it is a case of “cut and come again”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
and as often as you like. There is always something
to go away with. Mr. Lush, in a report
which he gave us at the time of the flotation of
this mine, estimated that we could reckon upon
having 500 acres containing 2 lbs. of tin per
cubic yard, and if that estimate is realised—and
I have no reason to anticipate that it will not
be realised—and the profits are made that he
foreshadowed might be made, you have a very
handsome property, and one containing apparently
something over half a million sterling worth of tin.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">BISICHI TIN COMPANY (NIGERIA), Ltd.</span></h3>

<p>This company was formed to acquire and work
mining rights over a property known as the
Bisichi Valley Tin Area, comprising an area of
three square miles in extent, situated in the Bauchi
Tin Fields. It is located about 12 miles south-east
of Jos, at the head-waters of the river Gongola, on
the main transport route from Keffi to Naraguta.</p>

<p>Mr. Laws, the general mining manager of the
Niger Company, in his report, says:</p>

<p>“One of the most pleasing features of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
property is its constant supply of water for sluicing
and power purposes, and the ample head of
water given by the three falls for hydraulicing.”</p>

<p>In the Bisichi Valley there is a large alluvial
deposit of light sandy material which is quite
free from clay, and is extremely friable, and
consequently capable of cheap and rapid concentration.</p>

<p>Black oxide of tin occurs abundantly in the
river beds and adjacent alluvial flats, and is of
very good quality, there being practically no iron
or other impurity associated with it. The tin-bearing
alluvial is all on the surface, and varies
in depth from a few inches to some 20 feet in the
vicinity of the river.</p>

<p>Systematic tests of the alluvial by trial pits
were commenced this year, and up to the present
the great proportion of the alluvial of the river
Bisichi has been tested.</p>

<p>The tested ground averages 4 yards in depth,
and contains approximately 2,120,000 cubic yards
of payable alluvial wash. The latter varies in
value from traces to 129 lbs. of black tin per
cubic yard, the average value being 7.27 lbs. of
black tin per cubic yard. The total contents of
the tested portion therefore amounts to 6,800
tons, exclusive of the river bed deposits, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the Niger Company’s engineers estimate to contain
about 1,000 tons.</p>

<p>The nature of the river-bed wash does not lend
itself to accurate sampling, but Mr. Laws, judging
by actual returns from similar deposits on this
field, considers this estimate of 1,000 tons a
moderate one, and states that it may be taken
that some 7,800 tons of black tin (containing over
70 per cent. of pure metal) have been developed to
date. Taking the costs as estimated by Mr. Laws
at £45 per ton, the above tonnage contained
in the area already proved, shows an available
profit of over £350,000.</p>

<p>Payable tin-bearing alluvial exists on other
portions of the Bisichi Valley area, but as it has
not yet been measured or tested, no exact estimate
can be made of quantities and values. The ground
already tested represents about one-tenth of the
total area; but the very high values and quantities
so far disclosed cannot be taken to apply to the
whole area, as it is natural that the course of the
main stream should carry better values and deeper
ground than the remainder of the land where
the alluvial would be more patchy and shallower.
It will be seen, however, that the estimated
working costs per ton have been placed by Mr.
Laws at a figure which will permit of lower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
grade ground being worked than that already
referred to.</p>

<p>Mr. Laws advises the immediate erection of an
hydraulicing plant capable of dealing efficiently
with wash dirt sufficient to produce 800 tons of
black tin annually, an ample head of water being
available for this purpose throughout the year.</p>

<p>He also states that it would be quite possible
to commence work on the property immediately
by ground sluicing; but he is strongly of opinion
that this policy would be unwise, as the disturbance
of the ground might tend to interfere with
the economical working on a large scale such as
is proposed.</p>

<p>Provided no unforeseen difficulties arise, Mr.
Laws is of opinion that the whole of the plant
would be in operation within nine months.</p>

<p>If Mr. Laws’ advice is taken, he estimates that
working cost would amount to about £10 per ton
on ore of the value already found, but, as stated
above, to allow for working a larger quantity of
lower grade ground, working costs should be
placed at £15 per ton of ore. The price of the
ore in the market at Liverpool may be taken at
£90 per ton, which, after deducting £15 for
working costs, and £30 per ton for transport and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
contingencies, would leave a margin of profit of
£45 per ton of ore. Although it is proposed in
the earlier stages of development to equip the
mine with plant capable of producing 800 tons
annually, any increase on this rate of working
will depend on surveys determining the head of
water available.</p>

<p>In a cable from Mr. Kemble, dated 8th August,
he states that he has acquired a further six square<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>

that he has acquired “another square mile extremely
rich.”</p>

<p>With regard to the exact locality of these areas,
Mr. Kemble says: “Mr. Knight will have plans,
report, &amp;c., ready for sending home as soon as

<p>The following was issued to shareholders on
15th September 1910:</p>

<p>“Referring to my circular of 29th August, in

rich tin area, in a letter just received from Mr.
Kemble, dated 3rd August, he states that as a

that there is plenty of water for sluicing purposes
during eight months of the year. During the
remaining four dry months of the year there is
ample water left in the pools. In addition to the
alluvial properties, the Gel Company has a half

which have been formed up to this date, are working
in the Bauchi Province, and as the Akerri Company
is proposing to work in a new district near
Zungeru, the present capital of the Colony, a copy
of Mr. Champion’s report is given in full:</p>

<p>“Having been appointed by you to prospect
and report on your tin properties in Northern
Nigeria, to which place I proceeded in March, I
have now much pleasure in submitting to you the
following particulars:</p>

<p>“<i>Situation.</i>—Your property is situate one day’s
journey in a south-westerly direction from
Zungeru, the present capital of the Colony, and
one and a half day’s journey north-east of Jebba,
which is an important railway centre.</p>

<p>“There is one important point as regards its
position, which places it far ahead of any property
of any company at present working in this Colony.
That is, you have as boundaries, on the north
the Lagos Railway (Northern Extension), on the
west the Kara River, and on the east the
Kaduna River.</p>

<p>“It is a granite country, and although in the
Naraguta district reefs have been proved to
exist, large alluvial deposits, which yield
cassiterite (tin oxide), are of chief importance.</p>

<p>“<i>Mining.</i>—For a couple of years the natives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
have been working in the rivers adjoining, and
also on your property, treating the ore in their
usual primitive way by means of ‘washing’ with
wooden pans or calabashes.</p>

<p>“Under my supervision a large number of
bore-holes were put down, varying in depth from
10 feet to 35 feet. I can form no idea as to the
depths of the tin-bearing soil, as on the western
boundary I have reached 35 feet in depth without
getting to the end, on the eastern boundary
about 30 feet in depth. You have over the whole
of your area alluvial deposits existing on a very
large scale. These deposits yield cassiterite
(tin oxide) containing on an average 62 per
cent. metallic tin, which proves the alluvial to be
as rich or even richer than you find in any other
part of the world.</p>

<p>“I estimate the yield at 7 lbs. per cubic
yard—equal to, say, 5 s. per cubic yard, with tin
oxide at £85 per ton. The cost of production
would be approximately 6d. per cubic yard.</p>

<p>“The extent of the property is great, the
natural facilities for mining are favourable, and
the output of tin will be simply proportionate to
the number of men employed. Assuming that
a minimum of only 250 natives be employed, they
should produce 500 tons of metallic tin per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
annum. Taking the price of tin oxide at £85
per ton, there would be a profit of some £36,000
per annum.</p>

<p>“The mining rights are over 3,200 acres, or
five square miles, granted by the Northern
Nigerian Government, and are subject to an annual
rent of 5s. per acre.</p>

<p>“There is also a 10 per cent. royalty on the
net profits derived from production, but I can
assure you that there is every prospect of a
reduction taking place in the near future.</p>

<p>“<i>Labour.</i>—This is undoubtedly one of the most
important questions with which mining companies
will have to deal at a very near date. This I
foresaw, and am now pleased to say that arrangements
have been made with the Zereki, or
Chief of the Village, close by, to provide you
with not less than 300 natives at any time or
date, the same are required.</p>

<p>“<i>Transport.</i>—This is another important question.</p>

<p>“At the present moment the railway has not
been completed, but I assure you that it will be
before the end of the present year. They are now
laying it at the rate of one mile per day, and are
only some forty miles from your property when I
left on 14th May.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>“In this matter you have a very great advantage
over those companies who are exploiting
the Bauchi district, for, to quote the words of
their expert, the cost of carriage from their tin
fields to Liverpool is some £27 per ton. The
cost to you will not exceed £12 per ton, so you
will have on every ton arriving in Liverpool a
clear profit of £15 more than they get. This is
a large margin, and when worked out on the
small production of 500 tons per annum (which
I have previously mentioned), means a sum of
£7,500 over and above what they can get on the
same quantity.</p>

<p>“<i>Water.</i>—There is no need for me to dwell
on this point, as the very large rivers you have
as boundaries will be more than ample supply
for all or any companies who will be operating
here in the near future.</p>

<p>“<i>Climate.</i>—Northern Nigeria is far different to
any part of West Africa. You are at an elevation
of some 500 feet. The nights are quite cool,
and any man who takes ordinary care of himself
and lives well ought to have good health. It is,
in my opinion, by far and away the healthiest
part of West Africa, and I say this after sixteen
years spent in different parts of it.</p>

<p>“In conclusion, the results obtained prove conclusively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
that there is immense alluvial wealth
which can be cheaply won, and I believe in this
property you have one which will prove an
astonishing success.</p>

<p>“I should recommend you to at once commence
operations on a large scale.</p>

<p>“A large working capital is unnecessary; and
I consider that £25,000 will be more than ample
for all requirements.”</p>

<p>This company has been formed to acquire the
exclusive rights to prospect for minerals, mineral
oils, and precious stones over an area of 3 square
miles, situated about 4 miles south of Bukeru,
in the well-known Bauchi Tin Fields of Northern
Nigeria.</p>

<p>The property is situated on the top of the
Bukeru Watershed, a basin heavily watered with
small streams running through the whole area,
which is stated to be alluvial, and all the ground
is tin-bearing from the top to the bottom of the
pits, which have been sunk to a depth of about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
15 feet. Mr. Lush, the consulting engineer
to the principal Nigerian tin mining companies,
who thinks well of the property, has consented
to act as consulting engineer for this
company.</p>

<p>A party, consisting of four engineers with
boring plant and stores, has already sailed for
Nigeria to take possession of and work this
property, as well as two other properties belonging
to the Gongola Syndicate, Limited, and
arrangements have been made for giving to this
company the benefit of this organisation, on
payment of a proportion of the charges incurred
and to be incurred in connection therewith.
There will be set aside £20,000 of the capital
for working capital, of which 10,000 shares will
be subscribed for immediately.</p>

<p>The purchase consideration is 30,000 fully-paid
shares to be allotted to the Wadu Syndicate or its
nominees, and the right to subscribe at par for
the unissued capital of the company.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that it is estimated that
a profit of at least £45 per ton of ore will be
obtained, taking the actual price at £90 per ton
and deducting £15 for the cost of working and
£30 for transport, &amp;c., which latter item will
shortly be considerably reduced.</p>

<p>This company has acquired a most extensive
property—nine miles in extent—and holds it under
an exclusive prospecting licence from the Northern
Nigerian Government. So far the prospectus
has only been privately issued. The licence
carries with it the right to select areas for mining
purposes for periods of twenty-one years, at an
annual rental of 5s. per acre, and a royalty on the
mineral output. The property is situated on the
head-waters of the river Gongola, the river flowing
through the area being locally known as the
Ribon. It is about 20 miles south-east of
Naraguta, and within easy reach of the main
transport route. There is a constant and unlimited
supply of water, and a large quantity of
timber suitable for fuel. The labour is plentiful,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
cheap, and suitable for alluvial mining. The
costs are put approximately at £20 per ton of
black tin, of a minimum of 70 per cent. Mr.
H. W. Laws, M.I.M.M., the chief mining engineer
of the Niger Company, says: “I consider the area
has excellent prospects of proving very large and
profitable, and that in selecting land for mining
purposes it will probably be necessary to acquire
two, and perhaps three, separate leases, owing to
its unusually large extent.” An engineer of wide
experience and an assistant has left London for
the property, and Mr. Walter Wethered, who is
paying his third visit to the Nigerian tin field, is
to attend to the Company’s interests on the spot.
The intention is that the Ribon Company shall
become one of the parent kind, because it is
quite impossible that, unaided, it can develop so
large a sett.</p>

<p>This company has acquired an exclusive prospecting
licence over about 1,440 acres of alluvial
tin-bearing ground, situated at Forum on the
Rein River, in the Province of Bauchi, which is
at present the richest known tin district in
Northern Nigeria. From this district alone over
one thousand tons of tin have already been won.
The property extends for a distance of about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
three miles along the river. Hand-washing by
calabashes and simple sluice-boxes, using a
stream of water, have been employed, and this
method will be adopted by this company for the
present.</p>

<h4>ESTIMATES</h4>

<p>By comparison with the results obtained in the
district it is estimated that, when the property is
opened out, an output of 50 tons a month or
600 tons a year of “Black Tin” should be
obtained, and the following results may be anticipated
on the basis of the report:—</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Sale of 600 tons of “Black Tin” at £90 per ton (the present
    price being over £100 per ton)</td>
    <td class="tdr"></td>
    <td class="tdr">£54,000</td>

    <td class="tdr">Estimated nett annual profit</td>
    <td class="tdr"></td>
    <td class="tdr total">£23,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>By about March the new freight conditions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
should be in force, which would increase the
estimated nett profit to about £29,000 per
annum.</p>

<p><i>Life and Tonnage.</i>—Assuming Mr. Wethered’s
figures that more than two-thirds of the area
carries 3 to 5 lbs. per cubic yard for a depth of
from 1 to 4 yards, the following is an estimate
of the tonnage of tin and the life of the property:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1,000 acres 2 yards deep at 3 lbs. per cubic yard should
yield about 13,000 tons of Black Tin over about 20 years,
which at £90 per ton represents a profit (taking into account
reduced freight) in excess of £500,000.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Management.</i>—An arrangement has been made
with the Lucky Chance Mines Limited, for
the superintendence of the company’s interests,
and for organising the work under a suitable
manager.</p>

<p>The following report by Mr. Walter Wethered,
one of the pioneers of the Northern Nigeria Tin
Fields, was made on the original concession,
which comprised an area of six miles along the
river, of which this company have acquired one
half.</p>

<p>“This property is situated on the south-eastern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
side of the Bauchi tin fields, between the pagan
towns of Forum and Rein.</p>

<p>“The area encloses about six miles of a stream
flowing in a northerly direction from Rein to
Forum, where it junctions with the system of
rivers on which the Ribon, Bisichi, Doss, and
other properties are situated.</p>

<p>“The area is three-quarters of a mile wide by
six miles long, an extent of four and a half square
miles, practically the whole of which is tin-bearing
alluvial. The alluvium is composed of a sandy
material of an extremely free nature, and the
bottom is the usual coarse grey granite. The
latter outcrops in very few places, and carries
from about a yard to four yards of alluvial
ground. Although the bottom could be reached
in only a few places in the stream bed, good
prospects of black tin were obtained in nearly all
samples panned, and from the alluvial flats, as
exposed by the banks of the stream, the results
ran from about 3 to 5 lbs. of tin per cubic yard.
The panning concentrates contained 10 to 15 per
cent. of titaniferous iron sand (which was allowed
for), but this mineral presents no difficulty, and
can be easily eliminated by the ordinary dressing
operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>“The width of the property (three-quarters of
a mile) does not include the whole of the large
alluvial flats that occur on either side of the river,
but having secured the river and so much of the
adjacent ground, these flats are protected, and, if
necessary, may be taken up when the land for
mining purposes is selected.</p>

<p>“Of the area staked, certainly more than two-thirds
carries alluvial ground of the thickness
given above. Except in the bed of the stream,
I would not expect rich patches, but a fairly
uniform value throughout.</p>

<p><i>Water.</i>—There is a continuous flow of water
for sluicing purposes all the year round.</p>

<p><i>Grades.</i>—Cannot be determined without survey,
but at the lower (Forum) end of the property
there is sufficient fall to allow the tailings to be
inexpensively dealt with.</p>

<p><i>Costs.</i>—Will compare favourably with other
mines in the district, <i>i.e.</i> with ground of moderate
value the costs would amount to between
£10 and £15 per ton of black tin, and present
transport charges £27 10s. per ton inclusive.</p>

<p>“Final tests of the flats are capable of being
cheaply and quickly carried out by means of trial
pits; boring is unnecessary. The probability is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
that the workable ground will prove to be of too
large an area to be included in one mining lease,
and that it will be necessary to split the present
area into two or more properties.”</p>

by the Governor, and the cost of such survey shall
be paid by the person applying for the lease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Overlapping areas.</div>

entitled to the use of all water within the area of
his lease, but he shall not, without the consent
in writing of the Government Inspector of Mines,
treat any river or other flowing water or stream
in such a manner as to prevent its return to its
natural channel before it leaves the said area.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proviso as to existing rights.</div>

<p>Provided that nothing herein contained shall be
construed to affect or prejudice the existing rights
of any person to the reasonable use of the water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
flowing in a natural bed or channel through, or

<div class="sidenote">Penalty for improper use of water.</div>

<p>23. Any person diverting any river, flowing

£25, or to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding three months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Provisions as to surface rights.</div>

<p>24.—(1) A mining lease shall not of itself
confer any rights in or over the surface of the
area included in the lease, but if the lessee shall
apply to the Governor for a right of occupancy
over the whole or any portion of the area included
in his lease, and shall show to the satisfaction
of the Governor that the exclusive use and enjoyment
of the said area or portion thereof is
necessary to the full and effective exercise of the
rights conferred by the lease, the Governor shall
grant a right of occupancy over such area or
portion thereof, subject to the provisions of the
law for the time being in force with regard to
such rights, and to such reservations as he shall
think fit to make in respect of any railway, tramway,
public road, building, burial-ground, or land<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
appropriated to any public purpose, or land in the
legal occupation of any other person.</p>

<p>(2) A right of occupancy granted as aforesaid
shall run concurrently with the mining lease, and
shall be renewable on application with each
renewal of the mining lease, and no rent shall
be payable thereunder over and above the rent
payable under the mining lease; but compensation
shall be payable in respect of any disturbance
of native rights.</p>

<p>(3) In the event of any application being received
from a third party for any rights in or
over the surface of an area included in a mining
lease, the Governor shall give notice thereof
to the lessee, and if the latter shall within six
months of the date of such notice show to the
satisfaction of the Governor that the application
cannot be granted without loss or damage to
him in respect of the rights conferred by the
said mining lease, the Governor shall assess
reasonable compensation to be paid by the applicant
to the lessee as a condition precedent to the
grant of the application. If, however, the lessee
shall fail to satisfy the Governor as aforesaid, the
Governor may thereupon grant the application and
no action shall lie in respect of any loss or
damage that may ensue in respect thereof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Compensation for damage.</div>

<p>25. Compensation shall be made to the legal
occupier by the holder of a prospecting right or
exclusive licence to prospect, and by the lessee
of a mining lease other than the holder of a
right of occupancy, for all damage done by himself,
his agents, or employees, to the surface of
any land upon, or under which prospecting or
mining operations are being carried on, or to any
house or building upon any such land, and the
amount of such compensation shall be decided
by the Resident of the province in which such
land is situated: Provided that if either party is
dissatisfied with the decision of such Resident he
may within fourteen days appeal to the Governor,
who may either decide the matter, in which case
such decision shall be final, or refer it to a court
for decision.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Royalty to be paid according
to regulations.</div>

<p>26. There shall be paid by all holders of
mining leases a royalty to the Government on
all ores, minerals, and metals won, which royalty
shall be at such rate as may be laid down in
the regulations made under section 34, and may
be collected in the form of an export duty or in
such manner and subject to such conditions as
may be laid down in such regulations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disputes between holders of mining rights as to mining operations.</div>

<p>27. If the holder of any right acquired under
this Proclamation shall consider himself injuriously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
affected by the mining or prospecting operations
of another, he shall report the matter in writing
to the Government Inspector of Mines. The
Government Inspector of Mines shall forward a
copy of the report to all persons concerned, and
after due consideration shall give his decision
thereon.</p>

<p>Any person may appeal from the decision of
the Government Inspector of Mines to the
Governor, after first notifying the Government
Inspector of Mines of his intention to do so, and
stating the grounds of his dissatisfaction. The
Government Inspector of Mines shall at once
report the matter to the Governor, who may either
decide the matter himself, in which case his decision
shall be final, or refer it to a court, which,
upon such reference, shall decide the matter in
dispute as though it came before it in the ordinary
course of law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interference with railways, public lands, &amp;c., forbidden.</div>

<p>28. No person entitled or claiming to be entitled
to any rights under a prospecting right
or an exclusive licence to prospect or under a
mining lease shall, in the exercise of any such
rights, without the consent in writing of the
Governor, disturb or interfere with any railway,
tramway, public road or building, burial ground
or land appropriated by law to any public purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
and any person guilty of any such disturbance
or interference shall be liable on conviction before
a court to a penalty not exceeding £100, and
in addition may be ordered by the court to pay
the costs of making good any damage caused
by him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forfeiture for breach of regulations, &amp;c.</div>

<p>29. If there shall be a breach on the part of
the lessee of a mining lease of any condition or
provision of this Proclamation or of any regulation
made thereunder, or of any of the terms
of his lease, and if the lessee shall not make
good such breach within three months from receiving
notice in writing from the Governor so
to do, or if the lessee shall wholly discontinue
operations under the lease during a continuous
period of six months without the consent in
writing of the Governor, then the lease may be
determined by the Governor without prejudice to
any claim against the lessee which shall already
have accrued. The decision of the Governor
determining the lease shall be sufficiently notified
to the lessee by its publication in the Gazette,
and shall operate to vest in the Government all
the plant, buildings, and other property of the
lessee in connection with the land leased without
any payment or compensation to the lessee in
respect thereof.</p>

any substance whatsoever which will increase
the value or in any way change the nature of the
